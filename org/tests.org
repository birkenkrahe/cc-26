    : Speed of light (m/s): c = 299792458
    : Euler number: e = 2.718282
    #+end_example

    But instead, it prints:

    #+begin_example
    : Speed of light (m/s): c = 0.000000
    : Euler number: e = -1610612736
    #+end_example

    Fix the program to get the correct output!

    #+end_src

    If the user enters:

    #+begin_example
    10.3 5 6
    #+end_example

    What will be the values of `i`, `x`, and `j` after the call?

      cat input
    #+end_src

    #+RESULTS:
    : 10.3 5 6

    #+begin_src C :cmdline < input :main yes :includes <stdio.h>
      int i,j; float x;
      scanf("%d%f%d", &i, &x, &j);
      printf("%d %f %d", i, x, j);
    #+end_src

    #+RESULTS:

31. Suppose that we call `scanf` as follows:

    #+begin_src C 
      scanf("%f%d%f", &x, &i, &y);
    #+end_src

    If the user enters:

    #+begin_example
    12.3●45.6●789
    #+end_example

    What will be the values of `x`, `i`, and `y` after the call?
    Assume that `x` and `y` are uninitialized `float` variables, and
    `i` is an uninitialized `i` variable. `●` stands for an empty space.

    - [X] `i=10, x=.300000, j=5`
    - [ ] `i=10, x=.3, j=5.`
    - [ ] `i=10, x=5.000000, j=6`
    - [ ] `i=10.3, x=0, j=6`

    #+begin_src bash :results output
      echo "12.3 45.6 789" > input
      cat input
    #+end_src

    #+RESULTS:
    : 12.3 45.6 789

    #+begin_src C :cmdline < input :main yes :includes <stdio.h>
      int i; float x,y;
      scanf("%f%d%f", &x, &i, &y);
      printf("%f %d %f", x, i, y);
    #+end_src

    #+RESULTS:
    : 12.300000 45 0.600000

32. The program should print:

    #+begin_example
    foo is 100, and bar is 200
    #+end_example

    But it won't even compile! What's wrong?

    Tip: there are two things wrong with this program.

    #+begin_src C
      #include <stdio>

      float main(void) {
        int foo = 100, bar;
        printf("foo is %d, and bar is %d\n", foo, bar = 200);
        return 0;
      }
    #+end_src

    - [X] The pre-processor declaration should include the header file `<stdio.h>`
    - [X] The `main()` function should be `int` and not `float`
    - [ ] You cannot assign a value to `bar` inside the `printf()` function
    - [ ] You cannot assign a value to `foo` when declaring the type as `int`

33. The following program statements should print out `300` on a line of its own, but it does not even compile! Two things are wrong with it. What are they?

    #+begin_src C
      int fvoid1=100, fvoid2=200, void;
      printf("%dn", void = fvoid1 + fvoid2);
    #+end_src

    *This question has more than one correct answer.*

    - [X] The keyword `void` is protected; it cannot be a variable
    - [X] There is a `\` missing in the formatter `%dn`
    - [ ] The variables `fvoid1` and `fvoid2` in `printf` are not recognized
    - [ ] The formatter should be `%f` and not `%d`

   - [X] `i` doubles until it reaches 16, then the loop stops
   - [ ] `i` doubles forever because the condition is always true
   - [ ] `i` stays 1 because the condition is false
   - [ ] `i` becomes 10 immediately

3. You want to print the value of `i` in each iteration. What’s wrong with this C code if `i` is 1 and `n` is 10?
   #+BEGIN_SRC C
     int i = 1, n = 10;
     while (i < n)
       i = i * 2;
       printf("%d\n", i);
   #+END_SRC
   - [X] The `printf` executes only once after the loop, not each iteration
   - [ ] The loop condition uses incorrect syntax
   - [ ] The code will not compile due to missing braces
   - [ ] `i` is not declared

4. When counting down with the following code, what is printed last if `i` starts at 0 and `N` is 10?
   #+BEGIN_SRC C
     #define N 10
     int i = 0;
     while (i < N) {
       printf("T plus %d\n", i);
       i++;
     }
   #+END_SRC
   - [X] `T plus 9`
   - [ ] `T plus 10`
   - [ ] `i = 0`
   - [ ] Nothing, it loops forever

5. For the countdown with the following code, what’s the difference if we use `++i` instead of `i++`?
   #+BEGIN_SRC C
     #define N 10
     int i = 0;
     while (i < N) {
       printf("T plus %d\n", i++);
     }
   #+END_SRC
   - [X] `++i` prints 1 to 10, while `i++` prints 0 to 9
   - [ ] There is no difference in output
   - [ ] `++i` causes an infinite loop
   - [ ] `i++` skips the first iteration

6. What condition would cause the loop in the following code to be bypassed completely?
   #+BEGIN_SRC C
     while (i < N) {
       i++;
     }
   #+END_SRC
   - [X] `i >= N` before the loop starts
   - [ ] `i` is not initialized
   - [ ] `N` is negative
   - [ ] `i++` is replaced with `i--`

7. In the pseudocode `WHILE num != 0 DO ADD num to sum READ num END WHILE`, what happens if the first `num` is 0?
   - [X] The loop never executes, and `sum` remains 0
   - [ ] The loop runs once, adding 0 to `sum`
   - [ ] It causes an infinite loop
   - [ ] The pseudocode syntax is invalid

8. What’s wrong with this C code for summing integers?
   #+BEGIN_SRC C
     int sum = 0, num;
     while (num != 0)
       sum += num;
       scanf("%d", &num);
   #+END_SRC
   - [X] The braces are missing, so only `sum += num` is in the loop
   - [ ] `num` is not initialized before the loop
   - [ ] It uses incorrect syntax for `while`
   - [ ] It lacks a `printf` statement

9. For the infinite loop in the following code, how can it be stopped from within the code?
   #+BEGIN_SRC C
     while (1) {
       puts("Endless...");
     }
   #+END_SRC
   - [X] Add a `break` statement
   - [ ] Change `1` to `0`
   - [ ] Remove the `puts` call
   - [ ] It cannot be stopped

10. In the summing integers assignment with input `8 23 71 5 0`, what is the final value of `sum`?
    #+BEGIN_SRC C
      int sum = 0, num = 0;
      while (num != 0) {
        sum += num;
        scanf("%d", &num);
      }
    #+END_SRC
    - [ ] 0
    - [ ] 2
    - [ ] 8
    - [X] 107

11. What’s wrong with this C code?
    #+BEGIN_SRC C
      int i, n;
      while (i <= n) {
        printf("%d\n", i);
        i++
      }
    #+END_SRC
    - [X] It’s missing a semicolon after `i++`
    - [ ] The `while` condition is invalid
    - [ ] It lacks braces around the loop body
    - [ ] Nothing, it’s correct

12. When summing nonzero integers from the keyboard, why does the `while` version read `num` before the loop?
    #+BEGIN_SRC C
      int sum = 0, num;
      scanf("%d", &num);
      while (num != 0) {
        sum += num;
        scanf("%d", &num);
      }
    #+END_SRC
    - [X] To check the condition `num != 0` before entering the loop
    - [ ] To avoid an infinite loop
    - [ ] To ensure `sum` is initialized
    - [ ] It’s unnecessary and can be removed

13. What output does this program produce? (Tip: remember that `i *= 2` stands for `i = i * 2`.)
    #+BEGIN_SRC C
      int i = 1;
      while (i <= 8) {
        printf("%d ", i);
        i *= 2;
      }
    #+END_SRC
    - [X] 1 2 4 8
    - [ ] 2 4 8 16
    - [ ] 2 2 2 2
    - [ ] No output

14. This program should output `12345` but it does not print anything and instead runs forever. Pick the correct expressions that would fix the program.
    #+BEGIN_SRC C
      int i = 1;
      while (i <= 5) {
        printf("%d", i);
      }
    #+END_SRC
    *More than one answer is correct.*
    - [X] `printf("%d", i++);`
    - [X] `printf("%d", i); i++;`
    - [ ] `int i = 1++;`
    - [ ] `while (i++ <= 5)`

15. The statement `while(1)` leads to an infinite loop.
    - [X] True
    - [ ] False

* Test 9: do-while and for loops

1. What is the main issue with this `do-while` loop?
   #+begin_src C
     int x = 0;
     do {
       printf("Counting: %d\n", x);
     } while (x > 0);
   #+end_src
   - [X] The loop condition is false from the start, so it only runs once.
   - [ ] There is a syntax error in the loop.
   - [ ] The loop will never terminate.
   - [ ] The loop increments `x` too quickly.

2. Why does this `do-while` loop fail to compile?
   #+begin_src C
     int num = 5;
     do {
       printf("Number: %d\n", num);
       num--;
     } while (num > 0)
   #+end_src
   - [X] It’s missing a semicolon after the `while` condition.
   - [ ] `num--` causes an infinite loop.
   - [ ] `num` is not initialized.
   - [ ] `while` must be written in uppercase.

3. What makes this `do-while` loop run forever?
   #+begin_src C
     int i = 5;
     do {
       printf("Value: %d\n", i);
       i--;
     } while (i < 5);
   #+end_src
   - [X] The condition `i < 5` remains true as `i` decreases.
   - [ ] The loop doesn’t include a `break` statement.
   - [ ] `i--` never executes.
   - [ ] The loop condition uses `==` incorrectly.

4. Why is this loop considered an infinite loop?
   #+begin_src C
     int count = 0;
     do {
       count++;
       printf("Count: %d\n", count);
     } while (count = 1);
   #+end_src
   - [X] `count = 1` is an assignment, not a condition.
   - [ ] `count++` is never reached.
   - [ ] `printf` is in the wrong place.
   - [ ] The loop is missing an increment.

5. What causes this loop to never terminate?
   #+begin_src C
     int x = 0;
     do {
       printf("Looping...\n");
     } while (x < 10);
     x++;
   #+end_src
   - [X] `x++` is outside the loop, so the condition never changes.
   - [ ] `x` is being decremented instead of incremented.
   - [ ] The loop condition should be `x == 10`.
   - [ ] `x` is uninitialized.

6. Why does this loop only print once?
   #+begin_src C
     int done = 1;
     do {
       printf("Done!\n");
     } while (done == 0);
   #+end_src
   - [X] The condition is false, so the loop runs only once.
   - [ ] There is a missing semicolon.
   - [ ] The loop is missing an increment.
   - [ ] `done` is a reserved keyword.

7. How can you fix this infinite loop?
   #+begin_src C
     int x = 10;
     do {
       printf("X: %d\n", x);
     } while (x != 0);
   #+end_src
   - [X] Decrement `x` inside the loop so it eventually reaches 0.
   - [ ] Move `printf` outside the loop.
   - [ ] Replace `!=` with `==`.
   - [ ] Change `do` to `while`.

8. What is the correct reason this loop prints "Hello" forever?
   #+begin_src C
     int flag = 1;
     do {
       printf("Hello\n");
     } while (flag);
   #+end_src
   - [X] `flag` is never changed, so the condition stays true.
   - [ ] The loop is missing a return statement.
   - [ ] The condition uses the wrong variable.
   - [ ] There is a syntax error in `printf`.

9. How many times will this loop run?
   #+begin_src C
     int i = 3;
     do {
       printf("%d\n", i);
       i--;
     } while (i >= 0);
   #+end_src
   - [X] 4 times
   - [ ] 3 times
   - [ ] 2 times
   - [ ] It never terminates.

10. What happens if the `do-while` loop condition is always false?
   #+begin_src C
     int i = 1;
     do {
       printf("Running...\n");
     } while (0);
   #+end_src
    - [X] The loop body runs once.
    - [ ] The loop body never runs.
    - [ ] The program crashes.
    - [ ] The loop runs forever.

11. What is the correct general syntax of a `for` loop in C?
    - [X] `for ( expr1 ; expr2 ; expr3 ) statement ;`
    - [ ] `for expr1, expr2, expr3 { statement }`
    - [ ] `for ( statement ; condition ; increment )`
    - [ ] `for each ( init ; cond ; step ) do statement`

12. What happens if you omit the second expression in a `for` loop?
    - [X] The condition defaults to `TRUE` and causes an infinite loop.
    - [ ] The loop will never run.
    - [ ] The compiler will throw a syntax error.
    - [ ] The loop will behave like a `do-while` loop.

13. Which `for` loop pattern correctly counts down from 5 to 1?
    - [X] `for (i = 5; i > 0; i--)`
    - [ ] `for (i = 1; i <= 5; i++)`
    - [ ] `for (i = 5; i >= 1; ++i)`
    - [ ] `for (i = 0; i < 5; i--)`

14. Why does this loop run infinitely?
    #+begin_src C
      for (int i = 10; i > 0; )
        printf("%d ", i);
    #+end_src
    - [X] The decrement of `i` is missing inside the loop body.
    - [ ] The loop condition should be `i >= 0`.
    - [ ] The loop should use `while` instead of `for`.
    - [ ] The variable `i` is not declared properly.

    #+end_src
    - [X] Nothing; this is a valid loop that counts down.
    - [ ] The third expression is missing and must be included.
    - [ ] `i--` should be in the header, not in the body.
    - [ ] Loop variables must be declared outside `for`.

19. Which of these is a valid `for` loop that omits all three expressions?
    - [X] 
      #+begin_src C

    - [ ] `int i = 5; for (; i > 0; i--)`
    - [ ] `for (i = 5; i > 0; i--)`
    - [ ] `declare int i = 5; for (i > 0; i--)`
     
21. In a `do-while` loop, the loop body is executed at least once even if the condition is false.
    - [X] True

22. This `do-while` loop will run forever:
    #+begin_src C :main yes :includes <stdio.h>
      int x = 0;
      do {
        printf("%d\n", x);
      } while (x < 10);

   - [ ] The array should be declared as a string literal.
   - [ ] The characters are not enclosed in double quotes.
   - [ ] The format specifier should be %c.

5. What does this code demonstrate?
   #+begin_src C :main yes :includes <stdio.h>
     int i = -4;
     int a[5] = {0};
     printf("%d\n", a[i]);
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : 2

   - [X] Accessing an array with a negative index causes undefined behavior.

8. In `scanf("%d", &i);`, why is `&i` used instead of `i`?
   - [X] To provide the address for storing input
   - [ ] To print the value of `i`

9. What does the unary operator `*` do when applied to a pointer?
   - [X] It dereferences the pointer
   - [ ] It increments the pointer
   - [ ] It finds the size of the pointer
   - [ ] It assigns a new address

10. What does the unary operator `&` do when applied to a variable?
    - [X] Returns the address of the variable
    - [ ] Multiplies the variable by itself
    - [ ] Creates a copy of the variable
    - [ ] Dereferences the variable

11. If you assign `p = 1;` where `p` is a pointer, what kind of compiler message do you get?
    - [X] Warning about pointer from integer without a cast
    - [ ] Error: segmentation fault
    - [ ] No warning or error
    - [ ] Warning about unused variable

12. When changing a value through a pointer with `*p = 2;`, what happens?
    - [X] The value at the memory location `p` points to is changed
    - [ ] The pointer’s address is changed
    - [ ] A new variable is created
    - [ ] Memory is reallocated

13. What happens if you dereference an uninitialized pointer?
    - [X] Undefined behavior
    - [ ] Memory allocation
    - [ ] Successful execution
    - [ ] Initialization of pointer

14. How should you correctly initialize a pointer to an integer variable `i`?
    - [X] `int *p = &i;`
    - [ ] `int *p = i;`
    - [ ] `int p = &i;`
    - [ ] `int p = i;`

    - [X] `%p`
    - [ ] `%d`
    - [ ] `%s`
    - [ ] `%f`

16. What value is typically used to initialize a pointer to "no address"?
    - [X] `NULL`
    - [ ] `0x0`
    - [ ] `-1`
    - [ ] `VOID`

17. When applying `*` and `&` together as in `*&i`, the result is:
    - [X] The original value `i`
    - [ ] A new pointer
    - [ ] A null pointer
    - [ ] The address of `i`

18. After assigning `p = &b;` where `p` previously pointed to `a`, what does `p` point to?
    - [X] The memory address of `b`
    - [ ] The value of `b`
    - [ ] The value of `a`
    - [ ] A new integer

19. If a pointer `ptr` is initialized with `NULL`, what does it mean?
    - [X] It does not point to any valid memory location
    - [ ] It points to memory address 1
    - [ ] It points to the beginning of the program
    - [ ] It points to random memory

20. What C keyword is used to declare a pointer to an integer?
    - [X] `int *p;`
    - [ ] `pointer int p;`
    - [ ] `int p*;`
    - [ ] `ptr int p;`
