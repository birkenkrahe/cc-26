** Description

In a game, a player can choose to equip either a weapon or a shield
before a battle. If they choose a weapon, their attack power
increases. If they choose a shield, their defense power
increases. Write a program that asks the player to choose between
equipping a weapon or a shield and updates their stats accordingly.

** What to Do

- Copy the starter code into OneCompiler.com/c.

- The pseudocode is written as comments (~//~), similar to the
  deposit/withdraw example.

- Replace the ~...~ with your own ~if/else~ statements to:
  + Check if ~choice == 1~ and add 5 to ~attack~ if true, printing
    "Equipped a weapon! New attack: %d\n".
  + Use ~else~ to add 3 to ~defense~ if ~choice == 2~, printing "Equipped a
    shield! New defense: %d\n".

- Run the code and test it:
  + Try ~choice = 1~ (should show "Equipped a weapon! New attack: 15").
  + Try ~choice = 2~ (should show "Equipped a shield! New defense: 8").

- Save your work and note any issues you encounter.

** Starter Code

#+begin_src C
  #include <stdio.h>

  int main() {
    // Pseudocode:
    // If the player chooses a weapon, increase attack power
    // Else if the player chooses a shield, increase defense power

    // Variables
    int attack = 10;  // Starting attack power
    int defense = 5;  // Starting defense power
    int choice;       // Player's choice (1 for weapon, 2 for shield)

    // Print stats and ask for action
    printf("Your stats: Attack = %d, Defense = %d\n", attack, defense);
    printf("Choose an item (1 for weapon, 2 for shield):\n");
    // Get choice (print confirmation)
    scanf("%d", &choice);
    printf("Your choice: %d\n", choice);

    // Add your if/else statements here
    ...

    // Show final stats
    printf("Final stats: Attack = %d, Defense = %d\n", attack, defense);
    return 0;
  }
#+end_src

** Expected Output Example
- Input: `1`
  #+begin_example
  Your stats: Attack = 10, Defense = 5
  Choose an item (1 for weapon, 2 for shield):
  Your choice: 1
  Equipped a weapon! New attack: 15
  Final stats: Attack = 15, Defense = 5
  #+end_example
