* Objectives

This course introduces you to programming using C. We cover C++ as an
extension. C is a system programming language of pure power: it
enables you to converse with the computer at a level unknown to users
other high level languages many of which come from C. You also learn
about: compilers, working on the command line, text editors Emacs,
using C for Internet of Things (IoT) devices, cybersecurity, using
pseudocode and process modeling. You get a foundation in critical
thinking in concert with two of the four currently most popular
languages (cp. TIOBE Index 2024): the next three languages are Java,
C# and JavaScript, which you can learn in a fortnight after this
course). You’ll learn some great tools: we use the “hacker’s editor”
Emacs, the world’s foremost software engineering platform, GitHub, and
BPMN for process modeling and pseudo code generation. For those
interested in computer and data science, this course is a bridge to
CSC 240, Data structures with C++, and CSC 265, Algorithms (with
Python).

* Student Learning Outcomes

Students who complete CSC 100.01 "Introduction to programming in C++",
will be able to:

- Learn sequential programming skills (conditional statements, loops,
  functions, input/output, use of data types, pointers, arrays).
- Explain the basic components of a procedural programming language.
- Apply programming to solve a variety of quantitative problems.
- Learn to use computing infrastructure (compiler, editor, shell).
- Know how to effectively present assignment results in written form.
- Be ready for "Data stuctures with C++" (CSC 240).
- Get ready for "Algorithms" (CSC 265).
- Improve data literacy, computational and critical thinking skills.

* Course requirements / prerequisites

- MTH 110 College algebra or permission from the instructor.
- No prior programming or computing knowledge os required.
- Experience with computers is useful but not critical.
- Curiosity is essential, and willingness to try new things!
- To get the most out of this course you must code, code, code! Also
  useful: Work through one of the (free) introductory text books.

* Grading system

You should be able to see your current grade at any time using the
Canvas gradebook for the course.

| WHEN   | DESCRIPTION              | IMPACT |
|--------+--------------------------+--------|
| Weekly | Programming assignments  |    25% |
| Weekly | Participation & Practice |    25% |
| Weekly | Multiple choice tests    |    25% |
| TBD    | Final exam (optional)    |    25% |

Notes:
- *To pass:* 60% of all available points.
- *Tests:* weekly online quizzes based on classroom lectures and
  practice.
- *Final exam:* random selection of the known test questions. *Note:* You
  only have to write the final exam if you want to improve your grade
  at the end of the course. If the final exam result is below your
  final grade average up to this point, it will be ignored.
- There will be numerous (optional) *bonus assignments* to improve your
  midterm and final grades.

* Rubrics

This course is listed in the core curriculum as oral communication
(OC) and problem solving (PS).

Two of the grading categories, participation and programming, will be
evaluated using two different rubrics.

The [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xEnXyFmTsek1IEaqLSU164Uo4VDOmGmR/edit][problem solving rubric]] requires that you are able to plan, execute
and comment a programming problem solution and understand what the
solution means in the context of the problem setting.

The [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XU8yEeKjdBTkjq6jvANG3zz4SeJ54x1J/edit][oral communication rubric]] requires that you are able to
communicate your approach and your results clearly and convincingly
for example by talking about it when asked, or by delivering well
commented code.

I will give you examples for deliverables in both categories that
"exceed expectations" as the rubric calls it when the time comes.

* Grading table

This table is used to convert completion rates into letter grades. for
the midterm results, letter grades still carry signs, while for the
term results, only straight letters are given (by rounding up). This
table is also used in Canvas to compute your grades. Transitions
between letter grades are rounded (e.g. 89.5% to 90%).

|------------------+------------------|
| Percentage       | LETTER GRADE*    |
|------------------+------------------|
| 100% to 89.5%    | A (very good)    |
|------------------+------------------|
| < 89.5% to 79.5% | B (good)         |
|------------------+------------------|
| < 79.5% to 69.5% | C (satisfactory) |
|------------------+------------------|
| < 69.5% to 59.5% | D (passed)       |
|------------------+------------------|
| < 59.5% to 0%    | F (FAILED)       |
|------------------+------------------|

* Schedule and Workload

For *important dates*, see the 2025-2026 Academic Calendar at:
[[https://catalog.lyon.edu/202526-academic-calendar][catalog.lyon.edu/202526-academic-calendar]].

*Workload* (estimated):
- Time in class: 48 hrs.
- Time outside of class: 42 hrs.
- Time for tests [1 hrs/test]: 14 hrs.
- Time for coding assignments [2 hrs/pgm]: 28 hrs.
- Total number of hrs in term: 90.
- Weekly workload (outside of class): 5.625 (2.625)

Note: If you invest less than 1 hour per week in the course, you will
not pass unless you've got a secret that I don't know of, or if you
already know C++ well. If you invest 1-2 hours per week, you may
pass. If you invest 2-3 hours per week, you can pass with an A easily.
