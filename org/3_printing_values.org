* What are you going to learn?

The secret of the success of the machine is the separation of *value*
and *variable*, or of numbers and storage place. When we *operate* on
numbers, we can keep the original operands and the result in different
places. For the computer to understand what we want to do, it needs to
see reserved words, or *keywords*, that have a special meaning. One of
the advantages of C is that there are very few keywords. To handle
numbers with its limited memory, the computer needs to know what kind
or *type* of numbers they are (for example, large or small, whole or
decimal). Printing numbers of a certain type requires us to specify
their *format*.

*Topics*:
1) [ ] Printing  (=printf= and =puts=)
2) [ ] Format (=%s=, =%i=, =%f=, =%c=)
3) [ ] Values (=1=, =1.0=)

* In-class and home assignments

- *Reading*: Chapter 2 (*Think C*) - pp. 13-22.

- *Practice exercises* (in-class):

  For in-class practice, we use OneCompiler (see below). You upload
  the link to your practice file to Canvas.

  1. Print different values with the wrong format specifiers
  2. Printing challenge

- *Programming assignments (home)*:

  Create a program that prints an integer, a floating-point number and
  a character using =printf=.

  You can submit the =OneCompiler= link to your solution file, or
  alternatively upload an Org-mode file with the solution, or upload a
  C file.

  My sample solutions will be available as Org-mode files on GitHub.

* Code along in OneCompiler

To code along in OneCompiler:

1) Open =onecompiler.com/c=

2) Open =settings= and change =Title= to ="Printing values"=

3) In =Editor Settings=, =Disable Code Autocomplete/Suggestions=

4) Change file name from =Main.c= to =main.c= (there can be only one)

5) Delete the body of the code (single Hello World print statement)

6) Now write any code from the lecture in the body of =main=

7) Execute with =RUN=

8) You find the complete lecture in GitHub as =2_variables.org=

9) Equip your code along files with comments liberally!

10) You can find the completed code along file here:
    [[https://tinyurl.com/2ab5sjle][tinyurl.com/2ab5sjle]] or [[https://onecompiler.com/c/4357nb852][onecompiler.com/c/4357nb852]]

Each code along session will fill about one screen:

* Code along with Emacs

- You can also code along with Emacs using an Org-mode file.

- Use the =test.org= file that we used during the installation.

- Create a new C code block with =<s TAB= and run code directly.

- It looks like this:

* Program structure (solution to the home assignment)
#+attr_latex: :width 700px
#+caption: main function structure (Collingbourne, 2017)
[[../img/3_structure.png]]

- All C program statements must be included in a ~main~ function

- The ~main~ function has a body delimited by ~{...}~

- There can be /pre-processor/ /directives/ - ~#include~ or ~#define~.

- ~main()~ is similar to ~f(x)~ in mathematics - () means "no argument"

- ~printf()~ prints its argument: ~"hello world"~ which is a 'string'

- ~\n~ means "go to the next line" - 'escape character'

- ~;~ ends every command - the computer waits for the next one!

- The computer (aka compiler) ignores "white [empty] space"

* Printing requires format

- The =printf= function can be called as many times as you like.

- The function's argument (between parentheses) can be a string:

  #+begin_src C
    printf("Hello");
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : Hello

- But two strings cannot be printed (you'll get a warning):

  #+begin_src C :flags -Wall
    printf("Hello, ", "world!");
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : Hello

- In Python, this would be possible:

  #+begin_src python :results output :exports both :python python3
    print("Hello,", "world!") # print two strings
    print("Hello," + "world!") # concatenate two strings
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : Hello, world!
  : Hello,world!

- In C, we can do this only if we tell the compiler what's coming:

  #+begin_src C :results output
    printf("%s %s\n", "Hello,", "world!"); // print two strings
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : Hello, world!

- The command =printf= is called a /function/ that takes two arguments: A
  list of arguments and a string that contains formatting information.

- In the example:

  1) ="%s %s\n"= is the format string: "Print 2 strings and a new line".

  2) ="Hello,","world!"= is a list of two strings to be printed.

- Much of programming (not just in C) boils down to picking the right
  representations for numbers that you want the computer to work with.

- This is not unlike college algebra where the way we write numbers
  helps us see relationships and simplify operations.

- Example: Factoring $x^2 + 5x + 6 = (x+2)(x+3)$ - this representation
  helps us realize that the roots of the polynomial (where it equals
  $0$) are $x=-2$ and $x=-3$.

* Printing over multiple lines

- To print "Hello, world!" over two lines, you can use one or two
  function calls:

  #+begin_src C :results output
    printf("Hello,\n");
    printf("world!\n");
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : Hello,
  : world!

  #+begin_src C :results output
    printf("Hello,\nworld!\n");
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : Hello,
  : world!

* Whitespace is (mostly) ignored

- As soon as a delimiter =;= is reached, all space ('whitespace') until
  the next command is ignored.

- Here is a version of the complete "Hello, world!" program that
  ignores whitespace at the expense of readability:

  #+begin_src C :results output
    #include<stdio.h> int main(){printf("Hello, world!\n");}
  #+end_src

- The only required space comes after reserved keywords (syntax
  highlighting reveals that because keywords are color-coded - though
  not in Colab)

- The /preprocessor/ directive =#include <stdio.h>= also must be on a line
  of its own.

* Values

- The machine only knows numbers:

  1) =1= is a whole or *integer* number:

     #+begin_src C
       printf("Integer number: %i\n", 1);
     #+end_src

     #+RESULTS:
     : Integer number: 1

  2) =1.0= is a decimal or *floating-point* number.

     #+begin_src C
       printf("Floating-point number: %.1f\n", 1.0);
     #+end_src

     #+RESULTS:
     : Floating-point number: 1.0

  3) ='1'= is a character (also stored as a number).

     #+begin_src C
       printf("Character: %c\n", '1');
     #+end_src

     #+RESULTS:
     : Character: 1

* Everything is a number

- To show that characters are stored as numbers, print it as a number:

  #+begin_src C
    printf("Character '1' as number: %i\n", '1');
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : Character '1' as number: 49

- Though we'll mostly work with these three, C has many different ways
  of representing numbers.

- Which representation (for example, long or short) is the best
  depends on the problem.

- Example:

  1) Adding 1 + 1 and showing the result is short:

     #+begin_src C
       printf("%i + %i = %i\n", 1, 1, 1 + 1);
     #+end_src

     #+RESULTS:
     : 1 + 1 = 2

  2) Dividing Euler's number (=exp(1)= by Pi (=3.14159...=) is long:

     #+begin_src C :includes <math.h> <stdio.h>
       printf("%.19f / %.19f = %.19f\n", exp(1), M_PI, 1E+9 / M_PI);
     #+end_src

     #+RESULTS:
     : 2.7182818284590450908 / 3.1415926535897931160 = 318309886.1837906837463378906

* PRACTICE About classroom practice sessions

- These and all of the following =PRACTCE= exercises are for you to
  complete in class. If you're not able, you should complete them at
  home using the available Zoom recordings.

- How you do this depends on you:

  1) If you have Emacs + Org-mode, you can do this effortlessly (but
     you have to know your way around Emacs + Org-mode). You can
     create new code blocks (like in Google Colab) and run them
     without having to enter =#include ... return 0= every time.

  2) If you only have a browser, you have choices as explained in the
     orientation lecture. =onecompiler.com= is the easiest:

     - Open [[https://onecompiler.com/c][onecompiler.com/c]] in the browser if you haven't done it yet.

     - Create a new project with a =main.c= file

     - Give it a suitable title like ="Variables - Practice"=, write a
       short description, like:
       #+begin_quote
       Project for practicing variables in C - CSC 100 class.
       #+end_quote
       and tag it:
       #+begin_example
       practice, variable, csc100
       #+end_example
       Make sure the visibility is *not private* so that you can post
       the link to Canvas if requested.

     - In the =editor settings=, check =Disable Code Autocomplete/Suggestions=

     - Delete the "hello world" template =printf= line and off you go!

* PRACTICE Everything is a number

- What do you get when you get the format wrong? The results will
  surprise you.

- Print these values using the requested format in a =printf= call:

  |   | VALUE | FORMAT         | SPECIFIER |
  |---+-------+----------------+-----------|
  | 1 | =3.14=  | integer        | =%i=        |
  | 2 | =3.14=  | character      | =%c=        |
  | 3 | =3=     | floating-point | =%f=        |
  | 4 | =3=     | character      | =%c=        |
  | 5 | ='3'=   | integer        | =%i=        |
  | 6 | ='3'=   | floating-point | =%f=        |

- Solution & Explanation:

  1. *Printing a floating-point number as an integer:* The output is an
     integer representation of the bits read by =printf= - it changes
     because the mismatch between the format specifier and the value
     argument causes *undefined behavior*.

     #+begin_src C :main yes :includes <stdio.h> :results output :exports both
       printf("%i\n", 3.14);
     #+end_src

     #+RESULTS:
     : -416628760

  2. *Printing a floating-point number as character*: Prints a garbage
     character (not recognized as an ASCII character).

     #+begin_src C :main yes :includes <stdio.h> :results output :exports both
       printf("%c\n", 3.14);
     #+end_src

     #+RESULTS:
     : ¸

  3. *Printing an integer as floating-point number*: Undefined behavior
     again. This result could also be another value.

     #+begin_src C :results output
       printf("%f\n", 3);
     #+end_src

     #+RESULTS:
     : 0.0

  4. *Printing an integer as character*: =3= is interpreted as the
     character with the ASCII code 3.

     #+begin_src C :results output
       printf("%c\n", 3);
     #+end_src

     #+RESULTS:
     : 

  5. *Printing a character as an integer*: Results in printing the ASCII
     code of the character.

     #+begin_src C :results output
       printf("%i\n", '3');
     #+end_src

     #+RESULTS:
     : 51

  6. *Printing a character as a floating-point number*: Undefined
     behavior.

     #+begin_src C :results output
       printf("%f\n", '3');
     #+end_src

     #+RESULTS:
     : 0.0

* PRACTICE Print challenge

Print =3.14 - 3 = .14= using =printf= and the values =3.14=, =3=, and =.14=

#+begin_src C :results output
  printf("%f - %i = %f\n", 3.14, 3, .14);
  printf("%.2f - %i = %.2f\n", 3.14, 3, .14);
#+end_src

* Summary: Printing Values in C

1. *Values* are data items like numbers or characters that the computer processes.
2. *Variables* store values and are referenced by unique names.
3. *Types* define what kind of values variables can hold (e.g., =int= for whole numbers, =float= for decimals).
4. *Format specifiers* like =%i= (integer), =%f= (float), and =%s= (string) control how values are printed.
5. *Keywords* are reserved words in C that the compiler understands as commands.
6. *Functions* like =printf()= are essential to printing values in C.
