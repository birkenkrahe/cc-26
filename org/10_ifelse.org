* Introduction

- *Objectives*:
  + Sequential ~if~ structures
  + Stacked ~if~ structures
  + Nested ~if~ structures

- *Theme:* Text-based adventure game—dungeon exploration and
  decision-making.

- *Objective:* Learn sequential, stacked and nested =if= structures for
  complex decisions in pseudocode and C source code.

* Sequential ~if~ structures

- Sequential ~if~ structures are evaluated independently and
  sequentially from the top. Multiple conditions can be true, and all
  matching blocks will execute. The outcome of one does not affect the
  others.

- Simple sequential ~if~ statements:
  #+begin_example C
  if ( i == 1 ) {
     // do one thing
  }
  if ( i == 2) {
     // do another thing
  }
  #+end_example

- An illustration in BPMN:
  #+name: fig:singleif
  #+attr_latex: :width 400px
  #+caption: Single IF statements
  [[../img/single.png]]

- Example:
  1) If you have enough gold (> 100), buy a sword.
  2) If you have too little health (< 100), drink a potion.

  #+begin_example
    IF gold > 100
       PRINT "Buying a sword!"
    END IF

    IF health < 100
       PRINT "Drinking a potion!"
    END IF
  #+end_example

* Stacked ~if~ (ladder) structures

** Explanation

- Stacked ~if~ structures test a sequence of conditions, but only one
  block executes. Once a condition is true, the rest are skipped.

- Simple stacked ~if~ statements:
  #+begin_example C
  if ( i == 1 ) {
     // do one thing
  }
  else if ( i == 2) {
     // do another thing
  }
  #+end_example

- An illustration in BPMN:
  #+name: fig:singleif
  #+attr_latex: :width 400px
  #+caption: Single IF statements
  [[../img/nested.png]]

** Example

- Game Context: After defeating an enemy, the player’s reward depends
  on their health.

- Pseudocode:
  #+BEGIN_example
  SET health = 60

  IF health > 75 THEN
      PRINT "You’re in top form! You find a golden shield."
  ELSE IF health > 50 THEN
      PRINT "You’re scratched but standing. You find a rusty sword."
  ELSE IF health > 25 THEN
      PRINT "You’re wounded but alive. You find a healing potion."
  ELSE
      PRINT "You collapse but grab a small coin."
  END IF
  #+END_example

- Source code: Run this in [[https://onecompiler.com/c/43bteavtn][onecompiler.com/c/43bteavtn]]
  #+begin_src C
    int health = 10; // SET health = 60

    if (health > 75)  // IF health > 75 THEN
      puts("You’re in top form! You find a golden shield.");
     else if (health > 50)  // ELSE IF health > 50 THEN
       puts("You’re scratched but standing. You find a rusty sword.");
     else if (health > 25) // ELSE IF health > 25 THEN
       puts("You’re wounded but alive. You find a healing potion.");
     else
       puts("You collapse but grab a small coin.");

  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : You collapse but grab a small coin.

** Practice: Loot by Difficulty

- *Task:* Write pseudocode for loot based on enemy difficulty
  (1-10). Use a stacked =if= structure.

- *Starter Code:*
  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  SET enemy_difficulty = 6
  PRINT "You defeat a monster!"

  // Add stacked if structure here


  #+END_EXAMPLE

- *Guidance:*
  - enemy_difficulty 8-10: print "You find a gold coin"
  - enemy_difficulty 5-7: print "You find an iron ring"
  - enemy_difficulty 1-4: print "You find a stick"
  - enemy_difficulty not a number > 0: print "Something went wrong - nothing
    found."

- *Example Output:* "You defeat a monster! You find an iron ring!"

- *Time:* 10 minutes to write and test.

- *Sample solution:*
  https://onecompiler.com/c/43bsst2mg

  #+begin_example
  SET enemy_difficulty = 6
  PRINT "You defeat a monster!"

  IF enemy_difficulty >= 8
     PRINT "You find a gold coin!"
  ELSE IF enemy_difficulty >= 5
     PRINT "You find an iron ring!"
  ELSE IF enemy_difficulty >= 1
     PRINT "You find a stick!"
  ELSE
     PRINT "Something went wrong - nothing found."
  END IF
  #+end_example

- *Sample source code:*

  [[https://onecompiler.com/c/43brbdw4f][onecompiler.com/c/43brbdw4f]]

  #+begin_src C
    int enemy_difficulty = 6; // SET enemy_difficulty = 6
    printf("You defeat a monster! "); // PRINT "You defeat a monster!"

    if (enemy_difficulty >= 8) // 8-10: "gold coin"
      printf("You find a gold coin!");
     else if (enemy_difficulty >= 5) // 5-7: "iron ring"
       printf("You find an iron ring!");
     else if (enemy_difficulty >= 1) // 1-4: "stick"
       printf("You find a stick!");
     else
       puts("Something went wrong - nothing found.");
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : You defeat a monster! You find an iron ring!

* Nested ~if~ Structures

** Explanation

- Nested ~if~ structures place one or more =if= statements inside another
  =if= statement, creating layered conditions. The inner =if= is only
  evaluated if the outer condition is true, allowing for decisions
  that depend on multiple criteria.

** Example

- Game Context: Opening a vault requires a key AND enough strength.

- Example:
  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  SET has_key = true
  SET strength = 40

  IF has_key THEN
      IF strength >= 50 THEN
          PRINT "You unlock and open the vault!"
      ELSE
          PRINT "You unlock it but can’t open it."
      END IF
  ELSE
      PRINT "You need a key."
  END IF
  #+END_EXAMPLE

- Key Point: Inner condition (~strength~) depends on outer condition
  (~has_key~) being true.

- Source code: [[https://onecompiler.com/c/43brdaaj4][onecompiler.com/c/43brdaaj4]]
  #+begin_src C
    int has_key = 1; // SET has_key = true
    int strength = 40; // SET strength = 40

    if (has_key) {// IF has_key THEN
      if (strength >= 50) // IF strength >= 50 THEN
        puts("You unlock and open the vault!");
      else
        puts("You unlock it but can’t open it.");
     } else {
      puts("You need a key.");
     }
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : You unlock and open the vault!

** Practice: Boss Fight (Bonus Assignment)

- *Task:* Write pseudocode for a boss fight. Success requires a sword
  AND high skill. Use a nested =if= structure. Write C source code and
  test it.

- *Starter Code:*
  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  SET has_sword = true
  SET skill = 70
  PRINT "You face the boss!"

  // Add nested if structure here
  #+END_EXAMPLE

- *Guidance:*
  - Sword + skill ≥ 80: "You win!"
  - Else: "You lose."

- *Example Output:* "You face the boss! You lose!"

* Example with stacked and nested conditional statements

- Game Context: After defeating an enemy, the player’s reward depends
  on their health. This includes both stacked and nested statements.

- Pseudocode:
  #+BEGIN_example
  SET health = 60
  SET enemy_defeated = true

  IF enemy_defeated THEN
      IF health > 75 THEN
          PRINT "You’re in top form! You find a golden shield."
      ELSE IF health > 50 THEN
          PRINT "You’re scratched but standing. You find a rusty sword."
      ELSE IF health > 25 THEN
          PRINT "You’re wounded but alive. You find a healing potion."
      ELSE
          PRINT "You collapse but grab a small coin."
      END IF
  ELSE
      PRINT "You flee with nothing."
  END IF
  #+END_example

- Source code: Run this in [[https://onecompiler.com/c/43br7x7b4][onecompiler.com/c/43br7x7b4]]
  #+begin_src C
    int health = 10; // SET health = 60
    int enemy_defeated = 1; // SET enemy_defeated = 1 (true))

    if (enemy_defeated) { // IF enemy_defeated THEN
      if (health > 75)  // IF health > 75 THEN
        puts("You’re in top form! You find a golden shield.");
      else if (health > 50)  // ELSE IF health > 50 THEN
        puts("You’re scratched but standing. You find a rusty sword.");
      else if (health > 25) // ELSE IF health > 25 THEN
        puts("You’re wounded but alive. You find a healing potion.");
      else
        puts("You collapse but grab a small coin.");
     } else {
      puts("You flee with nothing.");
     }
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : You collapse but grab a small coin.

* What about curly brackets?

- When should you use curly brackets after the ~if~, ~else~, and ~else if~
  statements?
  #+begin_quote
  Curly brackets define a *block of code* that belongs to that ~if~, ~else
  if~ or ~else~ condition. You should always use them because they make
  debugging (and writing code) vastly easier!

  They are *mandatory* when the block contains more than one statement.

  They are *optional* when the block contains only one statement.
  #+end_quote

- Code example:
  #+begin_src C
    int health = 10; // SET health = 10

    if (health > 75) { // IF health > 75
      puts("You’re in top form! You find a golden shield."); 
     } else if (health > 50) { // ELSE IF health > 50
      puts("You’re scratched but standing. You find a rusty sword."); 
     } else if (health > 25) { // ELSE IF health > 25
      puts("You’re wounded but alive. You find a healing potion.");
     } else { // ELSE
      puts("You collapse but grab a small coin.");
     } // END IF
  #+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: You collapse but grab a small coin.

* Conclusion

- *Summary:*

  - *Sequential:* Independent checks that can all execute if true (e.g.,
    buy a sword AND drink a potion based on gold and health).

  - *Stacked:* Mutually exclusive choices in a sequence (e.g., one
    reward based on health after a battle).

  - *Nested:* Layered conditions where inner checks depend on outer ones
    (e.g., needing a key AND strength to open a vault).

- *Next:* Switch control statement, and loops for repeated actions in
  the game (e.g., fighting multiple enemies).
