* README

- In this section of the course, we go beyond simple statements and
  turn to program flow and evaluation of logical conditions

- This section follows chapter 3 in Davenport/Vine (2015) and
  chapters 4 and 5 in King (2008)

- Generative AI (Grok 3) was used to simplify some of the exercises.

- Lecture, practice and exercise files available in GitHub

* Overview

- *Pseudocode* is a method to write down/analyze an /algorithm/ or a
  /heuristic/ without having to bother with /syntax/ (like ~&i~ vs. ~i~)

- The prefix pseudo- comes from Ancient Greek [[https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CF%88%CE%B5%CF%85%CE%B4%CE%AE%CF%82][ψευδής]], meaning
  "lying", "false" or "untrue", as in "pseudoscience" or "pseudonym"

- Pseudocode does not need to compile or run so it is closer to a
  heuristic than to an exact algorithm.

- Code however needs to be exact and is always algorithmic.

- *Always start with pseudocode* before coding, and when you're stuck
  (not because of syntax ignorance) go back to pseudocode.

* Algorithms vs. heuristic - Pólya's problem solving method

- The heuristic method à la George Pólya (1887-1985) in four steps:

  #+begin_quote
  1. *Understanding the problem:*
     - What is the unknown? What are the data?  What is the condition?
       Is it possible to satisfy the condition? Is the condition
       sufficient to determine the unknown? Or is it insufficient? Or
       redundant? Or contradictory?
     - Draw a figure. Introduce suitable notation
     - Separate the various parts of the condition. Can you write them
       down?
  2. *Devising a plan:*
     - Have you seen it before? Have you seen the same problem in a
       slightly different form? Do you know a related problem? Do you
       know a theorem or a law or a formula that could be useful?
     - Look at the unknown: Try to think of a familiar problem having
       the same or a similar unknown.
     - If you have a problem related to yours and solved before: could
       you use it? Could you use its result? Could you use its method?
       Should you introduce some auxiliary element in order to make its
       use possible?
     - Could you restate the problem? Could you restate it still
       differently? Go back to the definitions.
     - If you cannot solve the proposed problem try to solve first some
       related problem. Could you imagine a more accessible related
       problem? A more general problem? A more special problem? An
       analogous problem? Could you solve a part of the problem? Keep
       only part of the condition, drop the other part: how far is the
       unknown then determined, how can it vary? Could you derive
       something useful from the data? Could you think of other data
       appropriate to determine the unknown? Could you change the
       unknown or the data, or both if necessary, so that the new
       unknown and the new data are nearer to each other?
     - Did you use all the data? Did you use the whole condition? Have
       you taken into account all essential notions involved in the
       problem?
  3. *Carrying out the plan:* Carrying out your plan of the solution,
     check each step. Make sure that you understand each step and its
     consequences. Can you see clearly that the step is correct? Can you
     prove that it is correct?
  4. *Looking back:* Can you check the result? Can you check the argument?
     Can you derive the result differently? Can you see it at a glance?
     Can you use the result, or the method, for some other problem?
  #+end_quote

- You already know that you can (and should) make your programming
  easier by designing in pseudocode first and re-using it to code.

- This general method is overkill for little problems - but big
  problems consist of many little problems (and then some).

* Example: Pólya's problem solving method

- Example: Your height in light-years (programming assignment).

  #+begin_quote
  1) *Understand:* Separate problem into *constants* (=SPEED_OF_LIGHT=,
     =YEAR_IN_SECONDS=) and *variables* (input: =height= in [m] and in
     [light-years]), and =result=.

  2) *Plan:* Use formula (distance [m] = c[m/s]* year [s] [ly]) to solve
     the problem exactly (rather than approximately).

  3) *Execute*: Compute & use conversion factor on variables heights,
     and print with the correct formatting specifications (need right
     *data types*).

  4) *Check*: Do the resulting units of measurement come out right [m]?
     Does the resulting order of magnitude (E-16) seem plausible?[fn:1]
  #+end_quote

- *Tip:* Cycle back to old problems/programs that you once found
  challenging to check if they can be improved with new tools.

* Games and Early Computing

- Did you know that games helped shape modern computers?[fn:2]

* A Simple Game Problem

Let’s look at a small problem from a game:

#+begin_quote
"When a character’s health is 100 or less, drink a health potion. If
the health is more than 100, go back to fighting."
#+end_quote

We need to write this as *pseudocode*, which is like a pretend code
that’s easy to read and helps us plan before writing real code.

* First Try at Pseudocode

Here’s a simple way to write this idea in pseudocode:

#+begin_example C
// "When a character’s health is 100 or less, drink a health potion.
// If the health is more than 100, go back to fighting."

if health is less than 100
   Drink a health potion
else
   Go back to fighting
endif
#+end_example

- This is like giving instructions: "If the health is low (less than
  100), drink a potion. Otherwise, keep fighting."

- *Note*: This isn’t real code that a computer can run—it’s just a plan
  written in plain words.

* Why This Isn’t Real Code

The pseudocode above wouldn’t work if we tried to run it in a real
programming language like C. For example:

- It says *"health is less than 100,"* but in real code, we need to use
  a symbol like ~<~ (e.g., ~health < 100~).

- *"Drink a health potion"* isn’t something a computer understands —
  we’d need to tell it exactly how to do that in real code.

- What else might a computer complain about if we tried to run
  this?[fn:3]
  #+begin_src C
    int main()
    {
      if health is less than 100
                  Drink a health potion
        else
          Go back to fighting
            endif
            return 0;
    }
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:

* Making the Pseudocode Better

Let’s fix the pseudocode to be a little closer to real code by using
~<~ for "less than":

#+begin_example C
// "When a character’s health is 100 or less, drink a health potion.
// If the health is more than 100, go back to fighting."

if health < 100
    Drink a health potion
else
    Go back to fighting
endif
#+end_example

- Now it’s clearer: we’re checking if ~health~ is less than 100 using
  the ~<~ symbol, which computers understand.

* Trying a Different Way

What if we checked the opposite condition? Instead of ~health < 100~, we
could use ~health >= 100~ (which means health is 100 or more). Here’s
how that would look:

#+begin_example
if health >= 100
    Go back to fighting
else
    Drink a health potion
endif
#+end_example

- This does the same thing, but we flipped the order:
  - If health is 100 or more, we fight.
  - If health is less than 100, we drink a potion.

- Both ways work, but the first way (~health < 100~) matches the
  problem’s words more closely, which is usually better when you’re
  starting out.

* A Tip for Beginning Pseudocode Speakers

When you’re turning a problem into pseudocode (or real code), try to:

- Use words and ideas that match the problem description as closely as
  possible.

- If you’re not sure what the problem means, ask someone to explain it
  better (remember that 'understanding' always comes first).

- Unfortunately, trying to understand something can (and perhaps
  should make your brain hurt and make you feel bad for a bit).

* Questions to Think About

Using the pseudocode examples above, let’s think about these ideas:

1. *Words*: What words in the pseudocode match the problem description?

2. *Logic*: How does the pseudocode decide what to do (like choosing
   between drinking a potion or fighting)?

3. *Style*: Does the pseudocode sound clear and simple, like the problem
   description?

4. *Anything Else*: Are there other details in the problem we might need
   to think about?

* NEXT Practice: Turn a Problem into Pseudocode and Code

** Step 1: Understand the Problem

Here’s a problem about a game:

#+begin_quote
"Allow a player to deposit or withdraw gold from a game bank account."
#+end_quote

** Step 2: Write Pseudocode as Comments

- Open https://onecompiler.com/c.

- You’ll write your pseudocode as comments using `//` in the code
  editor.

- Pseudocode is a simple way to plan your code using plain words. For
  this problem, think about:
  + What choices does the player have? (Deposit or withdraw.)
  + How can you write this as an "if-else" decision?

- The pseudocode for this problem could look like this:
  #+begin_example C
  // If the player chooses to deposit, add gold to the account
  // Else if the player chooses to withdraw, subtract gold from the account
  #+end_example
  
** NEXT Step 3: Write Code

- The pseudocode contains a decision and an action. This pseudocode is
  closer to the C programming language:
  #+begin_example C
  // If (deposit chosen)
        // add gold to the account
  // Else if (withdrawal chosen)
        // subtract gold from the account
  #+end_example

- Open this code fragment in your browser as starter code:
  https://onecompiler.com/c/43bj66hz9

- Complete the `...` so that the program runs with two numbers as
  input: 1 or 2 for the =choice=, and an integer for the =amount=.

- Run the code and test it:
  1. Try `choice = 1` and `amount = 50` to deposit.
  2. Try `choice = 2` and `amount = 30` to withdraw.

- What kind of *error handling* might be necessary?
  #+begin_quote
  1. Checking for negative amounts (~amount < 0~).
  2. Ensuring enough =gold= for withdrawal (~gold >= amount~).
  3. Handling invalid choices (~choice NOT 1 OR choice NOT 2~).
  4. Dealing with input mistakes (~choice~ or ~amount~ NOT a number).
  5. Handling maximum ~gold~ limits (~gold + amount > 10000~).
  6. Dealing with input overflow (~amount > 100000000~).
  #+end_quote

- Starter code: 
  #+begin_src C
    // pseudogold.c: "Allow a player to deposit or withdraw gold from a
    // game bank account."
    // Input: choice (1=deposit,2=withdrawal, amount (integer)
    // Output: Deposited/withdrawn amount, new balance

    #include <stdio.h>

    int main() {

      // variables
      int gold = 100; // Example: starting gold amount
      int choice;     // To store the player's choice (1 for deposit, 2 for withdraw)
      int amount;     // Amount to deposit or withdraw

      // Print balance and ask for action
      printf("Your gold: %d\n", gold);
      printf("Choose an action (1 to deposit, 2 to withdraw):\n");
      // Get action (print confirmation)
      scanf("%d", &choice);
      printf("Your choice: %d\n", choice);
      // Get amount (print confirmation)
      printf("Enter amount:\n");
      scanf("%d", &amount);
      printf("Your amount: %d\n", amount);

      // TODO If (deposit chosen)
      if (...) {
        // TODO add gold to the account
        ...
          printf("Deposited %d gold. New balance: %d\n", ...);
      } else {   // Else if (withdrawal chosen)
        // subtract gold from the account
        ...
          printf("Withdrew %d gold. New balance: %d\n", ...);
      }

      return 0;

: Choose an action (1 to deposit, 2 to withdraw):
: Your choice: 2
: Enter amount:

: Withdrew 100 gold. New balance: 0

* Practice: Modify solution to handle errors

- First copy your entire program into a new program (so as not to spoil your
  nice solution).

- Now modify your copy to check if there is enough ~gold~ for a
  withdrawal (~choice == 2~).

- You have to
  1) find the right place in the program for the check
  2) use an ~if~ statement that tests the error condition
  3) print an error message as an action with ~puts~
  4) ~return~ with ~EXIT_FAILURE~ (~#include <stdlib.h>~)
  #+begin_example C
  // if amount exceeds gold
      // print error message
  #+end_example

- Run the code with choice ~2~ and the withdrawal ~amount~ of 200 to see
  if your error message is triggered or not.

- To think about until next time: Can this program be improved?

** Solution: Improvement

1) Move the error handling inside of the ~choice == 2~ block.
2) Now you can save one part of the condition check.

#+RESULTS: pseudogold3

* Practice: Buy or sell a sword

*Problem:* "Allow a player to buy a sword from a shop if they have
enough gold (50 gold or more), or sell a sword if they don’t have
enough."

1) Write pseudocode (not real code) for this problem in 2-3 lines.

2) Use simple words and an "if-else" structure, like we did with the
   "health potion" or "gold deposit" examples.

3) Assume the player starts with 40 gold (not enough to buy), and the
   sword costs 50 gold.

4) Take 5 minutes to write the pseudocode into the onecompiler.com/c
   starter code (remove the ~printf~ line).

** Example Solution (Pseudocode)

The pseudocode could look like this:
#+begin_example
if gold >= 50
    Buy a sword
else
    Sell a sword
#+end_example

** Implement the solution

- Complete the starter code according to the pseudocode:
  #+begin_example C
  // Start with 40 gold
  // Set the sword price to 50 gold
  // If the player has enough gold (>= 50), subtract 50 gold and print "Sword bought".
  // If not, add 20 gold (selling a sword and print "Sword sold".
  #+end_example

- The pseudocode has already been copied into the starter code:
  https://onecompiler.com/c/43bj5b7tx

- Test this with 40 gold, and then change it to 100 gold.

- Notice that there is no input required for this program.

    // Start with 40 gold
    int gold = 40;
    // Set the sword price to 50 gold
    int sword_price = 50;
    // If the player has enough gold (>= 50), subtract 50 gold and print
    // "Sword bought".  If not, add 20 gold (selling a sword and print
    // "Sword sold".
    if (gold >= 50) {
      gold = gold - 50;
      puts("Sword bought");
    } else {
      gold = gold - 20;
      puts("Sword sold");

* Footnotes

[fn:1]Light travels 300,000 m/s (E+6). A year has 31,000,000 seconds
(E+10). So 1 [m] is approx. E-(6+10) = E-16 light-years.

[fn:2]Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thompson developed the Unix operating
system and the programming language C largely because Ritchie wanted
to play a game "Space Travels" (like "[[https://www.nomanssky.com/][No Man's Sky]]", 2016-2025).

[fn:3]Undeclared variable ~health~, missing closure semi-colons after
the statements, functions ~Drink~ and ~Resume~ not known, and more. But
the compiler will abort after the first significant error already.

[fn:4] 1) Language: words used like ~health~, ~drink~ or ~resume~. 2) Logic:
[[https://ifttt.com/][IFTTT]] (If This Then That) Else That. 3) Tone: game language 'drink
health potion' as function ~drink_health_potion~. 4) The indentation and
the use of ~if else end if~ instead of, e.g. "WHEN health < 100 THEN
drink health potion OTHERWISE resume battle".

[fn:5]In Org mode, you can use the language as an example header
argument to enable syntax highlighting. For pseudocode, this will of
course not work perfectly, since most syntax elements are not in C.
