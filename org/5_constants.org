- [ ] Constants with macros or types (=#define=, =const=)
- [ ] Library definitions (=#include=)
- [ ] Reading input from the keyboard

- This script summarizes and adds to the treatment by King (2008),
  chapter 2, C Fundamentals - see also [[https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/14qvh00aVb_R09_hrQY0EDEK_JLAkgZ0S/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=102963037093118135110&rtpof=true&sd=true][slides (GDrive)]].

* Constants

- Constants are values that do not change (ever?)
- In C, you can define them with: macros, libraries, or as ~const~ type
- They have different degrees of permanency

* Macro definition with ~#define~

- If you don't want a value to change, you can define a
  ~constant~. There are different ways of doing that.

- The code below shows a declarative constant definition for the
  pre-processor that blindly substitutes the value everywhere in the
  program. This is also called a *macro definition*.
  #+begin_src C
    #define PI 3.141593
    printf("PI is %f\n",PI);
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : PI is 3.141593

- Can you see what mistake I made in the next code block?[fn:1]
  #+begin_src C :results silent
    #define PI = 3.141593
    printf("PI is %f\n", PI);
  #+end_src

- Can you see what went wrong in the next code block? If you don't
  see it at once, check the compiler error output!
  #+begin_src C :results silent
    #define PI 3.141593;
    printf("PI is %f\n", PI);
  #+end_src

- It's easy to make mistakes with user-defined constants. For one
  thing, "constants" declared with ~#define~ can be redefined (so they
  aren't really constant at all).

- The next program demonstrates how a constant declared with ~#define~
  can be redefined later with a second ~#define~ declaration.
  #+begin_src C :exports both :results output :tangle ../src/wert.c
    #define WERT 1.0
    printf("Constant is %.2f\n", WERT);

    #define WERT 2.0
    printf("Constant is %.2f\n", WERT);
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : Constant is 1.00
  : Constant is 2.00

- However, ~gcc~ is warning us about it (only on the command-line):
  #+begin_example
    wert.c: In function ‘main’:
  wert.c:12: warning: "WERT" redefined
     12 | #define WERT 2.0
        |
  wert.c:9: note: this is the location of the previous definition
      9 | #define WERT 1.0
        |
  #+end_example

* Library definitions with ~#include~

- Since mathematical constants are so important in scientific
  computing, there is a library that contains them, ~math.h~.

- Below, it is included at the start to give us the value of Pi as the
  constant ~M_PI~ with much greater precision than before:
  #+begin_src C :main no
    #include <stdio.h>
    #include <math.h>    // math functions and definitions
    int main(void) {
      printf("PI is %f\n", M_PI);
      printf("PI is %.16f\n", M_PI);
      return 0;
    }
  #+end_src

- Do you remember what happens if your precision ~p~ is greater than the
  precision delivered by the computer?[fn:2]

- You can redefine the value of any constant using ~#define~:
  #+begin_src C
    #include <stdio.h>
    #include <math.h>
    #define apple_pie M_PI   // from now on, M_PI is called `pie`
    int main(void) {
      printf("PI is %f\n", apple_pie);
      printf("PI is %.16f\n", apple_pie);
      return 0;
    }
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : PI is 3.141593
  : PI is 3.1415926535897931

- Inside Emacs with Org-mode, you can include the math header file
  ~math.h~ as a code block header argument (then you don't have to
  include it explicitly in your code block):
  #+begin_src C :includes <stdio.h> <math.h>
    printf("PI is %f\n",M_PI);
    printf("PI is %.16f\n",M_PI);
  #+end_src

- In Linux, ~math.h~ and the other header files sit in
  ~/usr/include/~. The screenshot shows the math constant section of
  ~math.h~.
  #+attr_latex: :width 500px
  #+caption: Mathematical constants in /usr/include/math.h
  [[../img/5_math.png]]

- Where is ~math.h~ in Windows[fn:3]? Where in MacOS? Find the
  file, open and look at it in Emacs (the file is read-only).

- In online IDEs like ~onecompiler.com~, you can typically not look at
  header files unless you have access to the command line or the file
  hierarchy - it does work in Google Colaboratory.
  #+attr_html: :width 600px:
  [[../img/math_h.png]]

- In the file, look for =M_PI=. You also find the definition of the
  Euler number e there[fn:4].

- Use it in a ~#define~ statement to define ~e~ and print ~e~ with 16-digit
  precision, with 15 decimal places:
  #+begin_src C
    #include <math.h>
    #define e M_E
    printf("%.16f\n", e);
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : 2.718281828459045

- It may be that you can do better than that on your computer (mine
  begins to make numbers up after that even though the constant is
  defined to a higher accuracy)[fn:5].

* Type definition with ~const~

- Modern C has the ~const~ identifier to protect constants. In the code,
  ~double~ is a higher precision floating point number type.

  #+begin_src C
    const double TAXRATE_CONST = 0.175f;
    double revenue = 200.0f;
    double tax;

    tax = revenue * TAXRATE_CONST;

    printf("Tax on revenue %.2f is %.2f", revenue, tax);
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : Tax on revenue 200.00 is 35.00

- What happens if you try to redefine the constant ~TAXRATE_CONST~ after
  the type declaration?

- Modify the previous code block by adding ~TAXRATE_CONST = 0.2f~ before
  the ~tax~ is computed, and run it:

  #+begin_src C :results silent
    const double TAXRATE_CONST = 0.175f;
    double revenue = 200.0f;
    double tax;

    TAXRATE_CONST = 0.2f;
    tax = revenue * TAXRATE_CONST;

    printf("Tax on revenue %.2f is %.2f", revenue, tax);
  #+end_src

* PRACTICE Constants

1) Create a =NEW= C program and call it =constants.c=.

2) Define the Arkansas sales tax rate (6.5%) as =SALES_TAX_AR= using
   the =#define= macro.

3) Define the Euler number as =EULER= using =M_E= from =math.h= using
   =#define=.

4) Define the speed of light as =SPEED_OF_LIGHT= using =const=.

5) Print all three definitions to get the following output using the
   constants you just defined.
   #+begin_example
   The Euler number is: e = 2.7182818285
   The Arkansas sales tax is: 6.5%
   The speed of light is: c = 299792458 m/s
   #+end_example

   /Tip: the =%= character is reserved for format specification. To
   escape it, use =%%= in =printf=./

*Program template:*
#+begin_example C
  // include header files
  ...
  // define constants
  ...
  /* main program */
  int main(void)
  {
    // print constants
    ...
    return 0;
  }
#+end_example

    return 0;
  }
#+end_src

* Reading input

- Before you can print output with ~printf~, you need to tell the
  computer, which format it should prepare for.

- Just like ~printf~, the input function ~scanf~ needs to know what
  format the input data will come in, otherwise it will print
  nonsense (or rather, memory fragments from God knows where).

- The following statement reads an ~int~ value and stores it in the
  variable ~i~.
  #+begin_src C :tangle ../src/iscan.c
    int num;
    puts("Enter an integer!");
    scanf("%i", &num);  // note the strange symbol `&`
    printf("You entered %i\n", num);
  #+end_src

- Test suite:
  #+begin_src bash :results output :exports both
    gcc ../src/iscan.c -o iscan
    echo 100 | ./iscan
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : Enter an integer!
  : You entered 100

- To input a floating-point (~float~) variable, you need to specify
  the format with ~%f~ *both* in the ~scanf~ *and* in the ~printf~
  statement. We'll learn more about format specifiers soon.

* PRACTICE Reading input

1) Copy the code in your =main= template:

   #+begin_src C
     #include <stdio.h>

     int main(void)
     {
       int num;
       puts("Enter an integer!");
       scanf("%i", &num);
       printf("You entered %i\n", num);
       return 0;
     }
   #+end_src

2) Run it with an integer input:
   #+attr_html: :width 600px:
   [[../img/reading_input.png]]

3) Modify the program so that it reads a floating-point value instead
   of an integer. You must make changes on three lines!

4) Test the program with the input (=STDIN=): 3.141593

** Solution

#+begin_src C :tangle ../src/fscan.c
  #include <stdio.h>

  int main(void)
  {
    float num;
    puts("Enter a floating-point number!");
    scanf("%f", &num);
    printf("You entered %f\n", num);
    return 0;
  }
#+end_src

Test suite:
#+begin_src bash :results output :exports both
  gcc ../src/fscan.c -o fscan
  echo 3.141593 | ./fscan
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: Enter a floating-point number!
: You entered 3.141593

[[../img/float_input.png]]

* Naming conventions

- Use upper case letters for CONSTANTS
  #+begin_src C :results silent
    const double TAXRATE;
  #+end_src

- Use lower case letters for variables
  #+begin_src C :results silent
    int tax;
  #+end_src

- Use lower case letters for function names
  #+begin_example C
    hello();
  #+end_example

- If names consist of more than one word, separate with ~_~ or
  insert capital letters:
  #+begin_example C
    hello_world();
    helloWorld();  // this is C++ style "camelCase"
  #+end_example

- Name according to function! In the next code block, both functions
  are identical from the point of view of the compiler, but one can be
  understood, the other one cannot.
  #+begin_src C :results silent
    const int SERVICE_CHARGE;
    int v;

    // myfunc: [no idea what this does]
    // Returns: t (int)
    // Params: z (int)
    int myfunc(int z) {
      int t;
      t = z + v;
      return t;
    }

    // calculate_grand_total
    // Returns: grand_total (int)
    // Params: subtotal (int)
    int calculate_grand_total(int subtotal) {
      int grand_total;
      grand_total = subtotal + SERVICE_CHARGE;
      return grand_total;
    }
  #+end_src

* Naming rules

- What about rules? The compiler will tell you if one of your names
  is a mistake! However, why waste the time, and the rules are
  interesting, too, at least syntactically, to a nerd.

- Names are sensitive towards spelling and capitalization:
  ~helloWorld~ is different from ~HELLOWORLD~ or
  ~Helloworld~. Confusingly, you could use all three in the same
  program, and the compiler would distinguish them.

- Names cannot begin with a number, and they may not contain
  dashes/minus signs. These are all illegal:
  #+begin_example C
    10times  get-net-char
  #+end_example
  These are good:
  #+begin_example C
    times10    get_next_char
  #+end_example

- There is no limit to the length of an identifier, so this name,
  presumably by a German programmer, is okay:
  #+begin_example C
  Voreingenommenheit_bedeutet_bias_auf_Deutsch  // Crazy German
  #+end_example

- The keywords in the table have special significance to the
  compiler and cannot be used as identifiers:
  #+name: tab:keywords
  | auto       | enum    | restrict | unsigned | break  | extern   |
  | return     | void    | case     | float    | short  | volatile |
  | char       | for     | signed   | while    | const  | goto     |
  | sizeof     | _Bool   | continue | if       | static | _Complex |
  | _Imaginary | default | union    | struct   | do     | int      |
  | switch     | double  | long     | typedef  | else   | register |

- Your turn: name some illegal identifiers and see what the compiler
  says!
  #+begin_src C :results silent
    int void = 1;
    float float = 3.14;
  #+end_src

* PRACTICE Naming identifiers

1) Create a =NEW= file.

2) Copy the code from [[https://tinyurl.com/cpp-naming-practice][tinyurl.com/cpp-naming-practice]] into the =main=
   program:

   #+begin_src C :results silent
     // integer constant for the speed of light
     const int ... = 299792458;

     // floating-point constant for pi
     #define ... 3.141593f

     // integer variable for volume computations
     int ...

     // character variable for last names
     char ...

     // function that adds two integers i and j
     int ... (int i,int j) {
       return i + j;
     }

     // variable whose name contains "my", "next", and "birthday"
     int ...
   #+end_src

3) Complete the code according to the naming rules so that it
   compiles:

   - Upper case letters for constants
   - Lower case letters for variables and function names
   - Separate names with underscore or insert capital letters
   - Name according to function

#+begin_src C
// integer constant for the speed of light
  const int SPEED_OF_LIGHT = 299792458;

  // floating-point constant for pi
  #define PI 3.141593f

  // integer variable for volume computations
  int volume;

  // character variable for last names
  char last_name;

  // function that adds two integers i and j
  int add_integers(int i,int j) {
    return i + j;
  }

  // variable whose name contains "my", "next", and "birthday"
  int my_next_birthday;
#+end_src

* Summary

- Constants in C are values that do not change during program
  execution.
- They can be defined using =#define= (macro definition), library
  constants from =math.h=, or the =const= keyword.
- =#define= replaces occurrences of a constant name with a literal
  value but does not provide type safety and can be redefined.
- Library constants like =M_PI= from =math.h= offer high precision and
  are predefined in standard headers.
- The =const= keyword ensures immutability and provides type safety.
- Naming best practices:
  - Use **uppercase** for constants.
  - Use **lowercase** for variables and function names.
  - Separate words with underscores (=_=) or use camelCase.
- Identifiers **cannot start with a number** or contain special
  characters.
- Reserved keywords like =int=, =void=, and =return= **cannot be used
  as variable names**.
- Constants are essential for input/output operations using =printf=
  and =scanf=, which require format specifiers.
- Using constants improves **code clarity**, prevents accidental value
  modifications, and enhances **program stability**.

* Footnotes

[fn:1]Answer: Instead of "~3.141593~", the expression "~= 3.141593~" is
substituted for ~PI~ everywhere - the program will not compile.

[fn:2]If the formatting precision that you ask for is greater than
the precision of the stored constant, the computer will simply make
digits up (which is not good).

[fn:3]If you installed the MinGW compiler (GCC for Windows), look for
it in the MinGW directory - there's an ~/include~ subdirectory that
contains many header/library files ~.h~. If you have Cygwin, you'll find
it in ~c:/Cygwin/usr/include/~. If you have MSYS2, look in
~C:\msys64\usr\include~.

[fn:4] Want to know more about this peculiar number ~e~ that occurs in
beautiful formulas like "Euler's identity" ($e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0$? See
[[https://youtu.be/m2MIpDrF7Es?si=P6Jffc_ImUo7RKQE][3Blue1Brown]] (2017). I added it to our [[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwgb17bzeNyg7P7LCIpKxBun95Eb_PK4O][class YouTube channel]].

[fn:5]This is due to inherent limitations of floating-point
representation (IEEE 754 standard): double precision numbes use 64
bits of storage, with 52 bits for the fraction (mantissa), 11 bits for
the exponent, and 1 bit for the sign - this allows for 15 to 17 bits
of precision.

[fn:6]The ~<..>~ brackets indicate that the file in between the
brackets can be found in the system ~PATH~. If a local file is included,
use double apostrophes ~".."~.

[fn:7]Python e.g. is white-space sensitive: the indentation level is
significant, it denotes code blocks, and needs to be consistent. The
same goes for Org-mode markdown and code blocks.

[fn:8]The tokenization is an important sub-process of natural language
processing, a data science discipline that is responsible for language
assistants like Siri, robotic calls, auto-coding and machine
translation (like Google translate), and bots like ChatGPT.
