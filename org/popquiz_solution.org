* Review: Control flow with ~if~, ~else~, ~else if~
#+OPTIONS: toc:nil num:nil ^:nil: 
1. Guess the type of ~if~ structure and the required pseudocode.
   #+BEGIN_QUOTE
   You’re exploring a dungeon. If you have enough gold (> 50), you repair
   your armor. If your health is low (< 30), you rest to recover. These
   actions are independent and can both happen. Write pseudocode with the
   correct ~if~ structure.
   #+END_QUOTE
   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE Sequential if structure
   SET gold = 75
   SET health = 20
   PRINT "You take a moment to assess your status..."

   IF gold > 50 THEN
      PRINT "You repair your armor!"
   END IF

   IF health < 30 THEN
      PRINT "You rest and recover some health!"
   END IF
  #+END_EXAMPLE

2. Guess the type of ~if~ structure and the required pseudocode.
   #+BEGIN_QUOTE
   You trigger a trap in the dungeon. Your fate depends on your
   agility (1-100). Write pseudocode with the correct ~if~ structure for
   these outcomes: Agility ≥ 80: "You dodge the trap easily!", Agility
   ≥ 50: "You stumble but avoid the trap.", Agility ≥ 20: "You’re hit
   but survive.", Otherwise: "The trap defeats you."
   #+END_QUOTE
   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE Stacked if structure
   SET agility = 45
   PRINT "A trap springs in the dungeon!"

   IF agility >= 80 THEN
      PRINT "You dodge the trap easily!"
   ELSE IF agility >= 50 THEN
       PRINT "You stumble but avoid the trap."
   ELSE IF agility >= 20 THEN
       PRINT "You’re hit but survive."
   ELSE
       PRINT "The trap defeats you."
   END IF
  #+END_EXAMPLE

3. Guess the type of ~if~ structure and the required pseudocode.
   #+BEGIN_QUOTE
   You find a locked chest. To open it and claim a reward, you need a
   lockpick (true/false) and dexterity (0-100) of at least 60. Write
   pseudocode with the correct ~if~ structure for these outcomes:
   Lockpick and dexterity ≥ 60: "You open the chest and find
   treasure!", Lockpick but dexterity < 60: "You fail to pick the
   lock.", No lockpick: "You can’t attempt to open the chest."
   #+END_QUOTE
   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE Nested if structure
   SET has_lockpick = true
   SET dexterity = 55
   PRINT "You discover a locked chest!"

   IF has_lockpick THEN
       IF dexterity >= 60 THEN
           PRINT "You open the chest and find treasure!"
       ELSE
           PRINT "You fail to pick the lock."
       END IF
   ELSE
       PRINT "You can’t attempt to open the chest."
   END IF
   #+END_EXAMPLE

4. What do you think of this problem/pseudocode?
   #+BEGIN_QUOTE
   You’re ambushed by goblins. If your strength is high (> 80), you fight
   them off. If you have a shield (true/false), you take less
   damage. These are separate actions that can both occur. Write
   pseudocode with the correct ~if~ structure.
   #+END_QUOTE
   Pseudocode:
   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE Wrong
   SET strength = 85
   SET has_shield = true
   PRINT "Goblins ambush you!"

   IF strength > 80 THEN
       PRINT "You fight off the goblins!"
   ELSE IF has_shield THEN
       PRINT "You take less damage!"
   END IF
  #+END_EXAMPLE
   Solution:
   #+begin_quote
   This uses a stacked ~if~ structure, implying only one outcome can
   happen, but both actions (fighting and reducing damage) should be
   independent.
   #+end_quote
   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE Correct
   SET strength = 85
   SET has_shield = true
   PRINT "Goblins ambush you!"

   IF strength > 80 THEN
       PRINT "You fight off the goblins!"
   END IF

   IF has_shield THEN
       PRINT "You take less damage!"
   END IF
   #+END_EXAMPLE

5. What do you think of this problem/pseudocode?
   #+BEGIN_QUOTE
   You approach a magical door. To enter, you need a magic gem
   (true/false) and mana (0-100) of at least 50. Write pseudocode with
   the correct ~if~ structure for: Both true: "You pass through the
   door!", Gem but mana < 50: "The door blocks you.", No gem: "The
   door remains sealed."
   #+END_QUOTE
   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE STACKED
   SET has_gem = true
   SET mana = 40
   PRINT "You face a magical door!"

   IF has_gem THEN
       PRINT "You pass through the door!"
   ELSE IF mana >= 50 THEN
       PRINT "The door blocks you."
   ELSE
       PRINT "The door remains sealed."
   END IF
   #+END_EXAMPLE
   Solution:
   #+begin_quote
   This uses a stacked ~if~ structure, but passing through requires both
   conditions (gem AND mana) to be checked together, not as
   alternatives.
   #+end_quote
   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE NESTED
   SET has_gem = true
   SET mana = 40
   PRINT "You face a magical door!"

   IF has_gem THEN
       IF mana >= 50 THEN
           PRINT "You pass through the door!"
       ELSE
           PRINT "The door blocks you."
       END IF
   ELSE
       PRINT "The door remains sealed."
   END IF
   #+END_EXAMPLE
