* What is programming? (Philosophy)
#+attr_html: :width 400px:

[[../img/plato_cave.jpg]]

- What is your motivation to learn a programming language?

- What's shown in the painting and what does it mean?

- What does it take to learn programming?

- What is an abstraction? What is real?

* What is a programming language?
#+attr_html: :width 400px:
#+caption: Tower of Babel by Pieter Bruegel the Elder (1563)
[[../img/tower_babel.jpg]]

- Language = Syntax (rules) + semantics (meaning) + metadata (context)

- In the Biblical Tower of Babel story, which language component is
  the core of God's punishment for the people's blasphemy?

- /Learning a programming language doesn't make you a programmer./

- /Solving many suitable problems by programming makes you a programmer./

* What is C? What is C++?

- C is a programming language created in the early 1970s.

- It grew out of the development of the UNIX operating system.

- In turn, UNIX grew out of a space travel game (Brock, 2019).
  #+caption: Ken Thompson & Dennis Ritchie & DEC PDP-11, 1970. (Brock, 2019)
  #+attr_latex: :width 400px
  [[../img/1_unix.png]]

- C++ is an object-oriented extension of C ("C with classes"), created
  by Bjarne Stroustrup 1979-1985. I learnt it in 1990 as my first
  "real" or "professional" programming language.

- C/C++ consistently rank among the top programming languages:
  #+attr_html: :width 700px:
  [[../img/redmonk.png]]

  /Position of language by # of Stackoverflow tags/GitHub projects./

* Why is C important? Why is C++ important?
#+attr_html: :width 200px:
#+Caption: C++ is a superset of C
[[../img/C_vs_Cpp.png]]

- C dominates real-world applications in every way:
  1. The *Linux* kernel (and therefore, *Android*)
  2. UNIX operating system (core of *MacOS* and *iOS*)
  3. *Windows* operating system (core of most PCs)
  4. *Doom* (early video game) and *Wolfenstein 3D*
  5. *Git* version control system (as in "GitHub")
  6. *Compilers* (Clang, GCC/MinGW for most other languages)
  7. Interpreted languages like *Python*, R, Lua, JavaScript)
  8. Any software that crosses platforms easily (*portable*)
  9. Software for the Curiosity Mars rover and most *space* apps
  10. *Banking*, *telecommunication*, and *military* software

- C++ dominates game software and other industrial applications where
  e.g. *graphics* are required. It accompanies many of C's
  implementations except for applications very close to the machine,
  i.e. with direct hardware access, low-level memory control, high
  portability and efficiency.

* Why don't we just learn C++?

- For comparison: "Hello world" program in C and C++

- "Hello world" in C
  #+begin_src C :results output
    #include <stdio.h>

    int main(void) {
      puts("Hello, world");
      return 0;
    }
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : Hello, world

- "Hello world in C++
  #+begin_src C++ :results output
    #include <iostream>

    int main(void) {
      std::cout << "Hello, world!" << std::endl;
      return 0;
    }
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : Hello, world!

- Object-orientation is a difficult paradigm for beginners (C++).
- System programming is pure power (C).
- C is simpler, smaller, and faster.
- C has 35 keywords, C++ has 95.

* Programming vs. Natural Languages

- Which has more syntax rules, programming languages (like C), or
  natural languages (like English)? And why?

  #+begin_comment
  - *Natural Languages* (e.g., English) have far more syntax rules than
  programming languages. They are ambiguous and context-dependent,
  requiring complex syntax to clarify meaning, evolve continuously
  over time (adding more rules), and are rich in variability. They are
  used (perhaps even "designed") for complex human communication.

  - *Programming Languages* (e.g., C) are designed to be precise and
  unambiguous small, well-defined set of syntax rules, they are static
  and slow-changing, focus on clarity and functionality, and
  prioritize simplicity over expressiveness to ensure machines "get
  it".

  - C for example has only 30 *keywords*, C++ has got 90, and English
  has 150 *function words* (like "articles", "pronouns" etc.) alone,
  and more than 170,000 words (and growing) in its vocabulary.
  #+end_comment

* Interpretation vs. Compilation

- Programming Languages are either interpreted or compiled to generate
  machine code from human-readable source code.

- Interpreted languages go straight from source to result:
  #+attr_html: :width 600px:
  #+caption: Scheffler, ThinkC (2019), p. 2
  [[../img/interpreter.png]]

- Interpreted example (the first execution shows the console)
  #+attr_html: :width 300px:
  #+caption: Python console / interpreter dialog fragment
  [[../img/python.png]]

- Compiled languages require an intermediate "object code" step.
  #+attr_html: :width 600px:
  #+caption: Scheffler, ThinkC (2019), p. 2
  [[../img/compiler.png]]

- Compiled example: The source code file (created with =echo=)) is
  compiled and executed on the shell:
  #+begin_src bash :results output :exports both
    echo '#include <stdio.h>' > hello  # redirect first line to file
    echo 'main() { printf("Hello, world!\n");}' >> hello # append rest of code
    gcc -x c hello # generate object code
    ./a.out # execute executable
  #+end_src

- Check out this nice demo video (1983, shared via Chat)

  #+caption: https://youtu.be/_C5AHaS1mOA?si=RL3l0Zftsldt0bPV
  [[../img/interpreter_vs_compiler.png]]

- The actual translation journey in the machine from source to object
  code is more complicated and involves a number of intermediate
  files and programs (open in browser - [[https://tinyurl.com/compiler-driver][tinyurl.com/compiler-driver]]):
  #+attr_html: :width 600px:
  #+caption: Source: Bryant/O'Halloran, Computer Systems (3e) 2015
  [[../img/compiler_driver2.png]]

- This diagram is a BPMN model that we'll use for pseudocode.

* What does the machine see?

- The source program =hello.c= is a sequence of bits or memory cells,
  each with a value of 0 or 1, organized in 8-bit chunks called /bytes/.

- Each byte in machine memory has an integer value that corresponds to
  some character. For example, the =#= has the integer value 35.

- Here is the source file as you see it:
  #+begin_src C
    #include <stdio.h>
    int main()
    {
      printf("Hello, World!\n");
      return 0;
    }
  #+end_src

- And here is the source file as the computer sees it:
  #+begin_example
  #   i   n   c    l   u   d   e  SP   <   s   t   d   i   o   .   h   >  \n
 35 105 110  99  108 117 100 101  32  60 115 116 100 105 111  46 104  62  10

  i   n   t   SP    m   a   i   n   (   )   \n    {  \n   p   r   i   n   t   f
105 110 116   32  109  97 105 110  40  41   10  123  10 112 114 105 110 116 102

  (   "   H   e   l   l   o   ,  SP   W   o   r   l   d   !   \   n   "   )   ;
 40  34  72 101 108 108 111  44  32  87 111 114 108 100  33  92 110  34  41  59

 \n   r   e   t   u   r   n  SP   0   ;  \n    }  \n
 10 114 101 116 117 114 110  32  48  59  10  125  10
  #+end_example

- *Note:* The stand-alone /newline/ character =\n= (10) is different from ="\n"=
  inside a string (92 + 10).

* What is a (software) program?

- Is this a program or not?
  #+attr_html: :width 600px:
  #+caption: Banana muffin recipe
  [[../img/recipe.jpg]]

- Answer:
  #+begin_comment
  - The recipe is a set of instructions but not for computation by a
  computer, and not hampered by syntax rules (other than English
  grammar). It's a form of algorithm written in pseudocode. It is not
  written in a programming language.

  - It has some properties of a good program: A program header with
  title, author and date information, and other meta data (how many
  are served).

  - Meta data are equally important for programming but they are not
  standardized unless the program is sent over a computer network
  (then the program header is used like an address on an envelope).
  #+end_comment

- What about this?
  #+attr_html: :width 600px:
  #+caption: "Hello World" in x86 Assembly using Linux system calls
  [[../img/assembly.png]]

- The general template for a program:

  1. *Input* (fed to the program from the outside, or =stdin=)

  2. *Output* (generated by the program for the outside, or =stdout=)

  3. *Statements* (commands other than I/O).

  4. Baking recipe example:

     - Input = Baking ingredients
     - Output = Banana muffin
     - Statements = Baking instructions

  5. "Hello, world!" program:

     - Input = Character sequence: ="Hello, world"= (string)
     - Output = Screen message =Hello, world!= (stdin)
     - Statements = e.g. =printf("Hello, world!\n");= (function call)

* What make programs work (hardware)?
#+caption: Computer architecture (simplified)
#+attr_latex: :width 600px
[[../img/1_infrastructure.png]]

(a) CPU + RAM + Non-Volatile Memory (NVM)

- Central Processing Unit ("brain"): very, very fast. General purpose
  (like Intel Core, AMD Ryzen or Apple M-series); embedded CPUs (on
  microcontrollers); server CPUs (Intel XEON, AMD's EPYC).

- GPUs are workhorses for parallel computing that usually run
  alongside a CPU (e.g. for fast scientific or graphics
  calculations). An example for AI is Google's TPU (Tensor Processing
  Unit) designed specifically for neural network machine learning.

- Secondary storage (non-volatile memory, NVM): very, very slow. Much
  too slow for the CPU. NVM can be a hard disk, or a Solid State Drive
  (SSD) - it doesn't disappear when the power goes off (by way of
  permanent magnetic fields).

b) Main memory (Random Access Memory): fast enough for the
CPU. Organized as a "stack" of memory addresses. All programs must
be loaded into memory before they can be executed. In C, you can
access memory cells directly through the "pointer" data structure.

* What is debugging?

- Programming is the process of creating programs that run and do what
  you want them to do (print, draw, compute, operate something).

- Debugging is when things don't go well and you get errors (or
  warnings), or unexpected results, or no results.

- Programming with debugging includes these steps:

  1) *Understand* the problem (if there is one).

  2) *Plan* a computational solution (if there is one).

  3) *Open* an editor

  4) *Enter* source code (statements + comments)

  5) *Save* source code to a file

  6) *Close* the editor

  7) *Compile* source code to an executable file (debug syntax)

  8) *Run* the executable file

  9) *Check* the results (debug logic)

  10) *Perform* a post-mortem

* The first program (Demo with Cloud shell + nano)

Traditionally (since [[https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0131103628/lynnallain][K&R, 1978]]), the first program in any language is
"Hello, world!". It's very small but it packs a punch.

I will demonstrate the whole process using a cloud editor + shell now,
and you will later do it in an integrated development environment
(IDE).

1) Problem: Print the message =Hello, world!= to the screen.

2) Cognitive solution requires ability/decision to:
   1. Generate a text message
   2. Format it as a string that the machine can identify (quotation)
   3. Know how the machine prints strings (function)
   4. Know how to get the printing function (include header file)
   5. Know how to wrap the solution in a program (header/main)

3) Open Open Google Cloud Shell, & enter =nano= at the prompt.

4) Write the code line by line using your keyboard.

5) Save to a file =hello.c= with =CTRL + X=.

6) Leave =nano=.

7) Compile the source code file with the GCC compiler =gcc=.

8) Run the executable output file at the prompt as =./a.out=.

9) Check the resulting printout.

10) Post-mortem (FAQ) & reflection:
    1. Which of these steps transfer every time you code?
    2. How does =printf= work? How can you find out more about it?
    3. Are double and single quotes equally valid for strings?
    4. How easy is it to use =nano=? Did you try something else?
    5. In =nano=, did you try any of the other commands?
    6. Is GCC the only compiler for the C programming language?
    7. How can you find out more about the =gcc= command?
    8. What is the command-line where you compile & run code?
    9. Why is the output file called =a.out=?
    10. Why do you run the file using =./a.out=?

* Online programming platforms
#+attr_html: :width 600px:
#+caption: https://xkcd.com/378
[[../img/real_programmers.png]]

- The cartoon by [[https://xkcd.com/378][xkcd (Randall Munroe)]] contains a lot of information
  about editors:
  1) =nano= (what I've just used for the demonstration)
  2) =Emacs= (what I'm using at home and in class - *1985)
  3) =vim= (improved =vi= - *1976)
  4) =ed= (UNIX' original line editor, *1971)
  5) =cat= (GNU/Linux core utility viewing program)
  6) "Butterflies" (Chaos Theory)
  7) /Jupyter/ notebook (in Google Colaboratory)

- Many alternatives to Google Cloud Shell/Colab exist but they either
  have advertisements, require your credit card, want to sell you
  something, or are IDEs (Integrated Development Environments):
  1. [[https://onecompiler.com/c][onecompiler.com/c]] (IDE only)
  2. [[https://onlinegdb.com][onlinegdb.com]] (with command-line)
  3. [[https://pythontutor.com/c.html][pythontutor.com]] (with visualization)
  4. [[https://www.programiz.com/c-programming/online-compiler/][programiz.com/c-programming/online-compiler/]] (IDE)
  5. [[https://ide.geeksforgeeks.org/ide/online-c-compiler][geeksforgeeks.org/ide/online-c-compiler]] (IDE)
  6. [[https://replit.com][replit.com]] is an online REPL (Read-Eval-Print-Loop) application
  7. [[https://github.com/codespaces][github.com/codespaces]] (free for students, with AI support)
  8. [[https://vscode.dev][vscode.dev]] (IDE)

- In all scenarios, you need three software applications for C:
  1) An *editor* to write the source code.
  2) A *compiler* to translate source code into object code.
  3) A *shell* to execute the object code and see the results.

* Making and fixing mistakes

- The compiler tries to direct you to the source of the problem.

- Example error output for this innocent looking program:
  #+attr_html: :width 600px:
  #+caption: C program and compiler error message
  [[../img/error.png]]

- Alternatives are the use of a debugging tool (like =gdb=), or an
  online visualizer like =pythontutor.com=.

- Mistakes will occur in three scenarios:

  1) When you compile ("compile-time error" usually "syntax error")

  2) When you run the program ("run-time error")

  3) When you look at the results ("logical error")

- The more time you save preparing, the more you lose debugging.

- *Syntax highlighting* also helps greatly. Compare these two versions
  of the same program:
  #+attr_html: :width 600px:
  #+caption: Code block without syntax highlighting
  [[../img/fragment1.png]]

  #+attr_html: :width 600px:
  #+caption: Code block with syntax highlighting
  [[../img/fragment2.png]]

- One disadvantage of Google Colab compared to Google Cloud shell is
  the missing syntax highlighting.

- As you get better, you'll want to design your own coding
  environment that supports your ideal workflow.

* PRACTICE C Programming with OneCompiler
** Objective

The goal of this tutorial is to introduce students to
writing, compiling, and running simple C programs using
OneCompiler.com.

This is important so that you can complete your assignments & follow
along with me in class while coding ("code along") if you wish.

** Getting Started with OneCompiler

1. Open your web browser and go to https://onecompiler.com/c
2. Sign up to the platform using your Lyon Google account (@lyon.edu).
3. Click on the "+" and select "C" as the programming language.
4. You will see a default template with a simple C program.

** Creating a new C file in OneCompiler

OneCompiler has two organisational levels: 1) code, 2) file, and we'll
change them both.

1. Open the /three dots/ on the right and pick "Title & Visibility".

2. Change the name of the code to ="Hello World"= and add a short
   description:
   #+begin_comment
   First program with OneCompiler. CSC 100 class practice: 01/24/2025.
   #+end_comment

3. Add the tag =helloworld=. Tags help greatly with search + find.

4. Check the =Visibility=, change it to =Unlisted (People with the Link)=,
   and click on =Save=.

5. Open the main menu (three horizontal lines, upper left side) and
   choose =My Account=.

6. Click on =CODES=. You should see the last code you edited. If you use
   dark mode (button at top of the page), you won't see the tag. In
   the settings (three dots) you can change the visibility or delete
   the code.

7. Click on the name of your code to get back to the editor view.

8. Hovering over the filename =NewFile1.c=, find the edit pen: In the
   popup, enter a new file name: =helloworld.c=.

9. To clean the slate, open the settings (three dots) and choose
   =Clear Output=. You can also download your file from here.

10. Open the setting again, and choose =Editor Settings=. In the popup,
    check =Disable Code Autocomplete/Suggestions=.

** Basic Structure of a C Program

Every C program has a basic structure:

- Header information (/preprocessor/)
- =main= program ending with =return 0;=
- Program body enclosed in ={ }=
- Comments (optional) followed by =//= or enclosed in =/* */=

#+begin_src C
  #include <stdio.h>

  int main(void) {
    puts("Hello, World!");
    return 0;
  }
#+end_src

Your task:
1. Type the program (with comments) into the editor.
2. At the end of each line, press =Enter=.
3. At the start of a new line, press =TAB= to indent
4. The file is automatically saved.
5. Click =RUN= (or =CTRL + ENTER)= and check the =Output= field.

#+attr_html: :width 600px:
#+caption: Final result in OneCompiler.com
[[../img/2_practice2.png]]

** Downloading and uploading files

1) Add a program header. Adapt the header below to your own program:
   #+begin_example
   /*****************************************/
   /* helloworld.c: Print greeting string   */
   /* Input: none                           */
   /* Output: Hello, world!                 */                     
   /* Author: Marcus Birkenkrahe (pledged)  */
   /* Date: 1/4/2025                        */
   /*****************************************/
   #+end_example

2) After making sure that the program (still) produces the desired
   output, =Download= it to your PC using the settings menu (three dots)
   as =helloworld.c=.

3) Open Canvas and find the =Getting started with OneCompiler=
   assignment.

4) Upload the link (URL) to the online file. You find it in the status
   bar of your browser. Mine is: https://onecompiler.com/c/43546aswu

#+attr_html: :width 600px: 
#+caption: Final result in OneCompiler.com
[[../img/2_practice.png]]

** Extensions

- Below the editor, there is extensive Syntax help for C programming,
  check it out.

- OneCompiler offers a nice free [[https://onecompiler.com/tutorials/c][C tutorial]] if you want to work
  ahead. You find it in the top menu (three horizontal lines).

- There are programming [[https://onecompiler.com/challenges][challenges]] (some of which we'll be doing in
  and outside of class). You have to pick your language.

- There are [[https://onecompiler.com/cheatsheets][cheatsheets]], as a useful reference or a condensed overview
  of an advanced topic - check out =C++ Programming language=.

- Next time you want to get back straight to the C editor, go to
  =onecompiler.com/c=.

* Tips and Extensions

1. It is advisable, especially at the start, to err on the side of
   over-commenting. Creating comments will be your first assignment.

2. Things to try when writing the program:
   - What happens if you compile with =printf();= ?
   - What happens if you leave out the =int= before =main=?
   - What happens if you remove the last line, =return 0;= ?
   - What happens if you remove everything but =main() {}=?

3. Things to try when compiling and running the program on a shell
   (you cannot do this in the OneCompiler IDE):
   - Run the program again with the command: =./a.out > hello=
   - Look at the output file with: =cat hello=
   - Compile again with: =gcc hello.c -o hello.out=
   - Run the program with the command: =./hello.out=
   - Run the program again with the command: =./hello.out > hello.txt=
   - Look at the output file with: =cat hello.txt=
   - List all files starting with =hello=, with: =ls hello*=

Explanation:
#+begin_comment
- The =printf= command requires a non-empty argument, at least =""=.

- The =main= program will still run in its reduced form. The complete
form is quite a bit more complicated.

- =gcc [source] -o [target]= creates object code (executable) named
=target=.

- You can also redirect the output from the executable to a file using
the /redirection/ shell operator =>=.
#+end_comment

For illustration, here is a complete =main= program: The argument is not
=void= (missing) but instead contains the number of arguments =argc=, and
an array of pointers =argv[]= to each argument passed to the program.

#+begin_src C :main no :includes
  #include <stdio.h>

  int main(int argc, char *argv[])
  {
    printf("Hello, world!\n");
    return 0;
  }
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: Hello, world!

* Summary

The content explores foundational programming concepts and practices:
1. *What is Programming?* Programming is the process of creating
   instructions for a computer to solve problems.
2. *What is a Programming Language?* A programming language consists of
   syntax (rules), semantics (meaning), and metadata (context). The
   Biblical Tower of Babel metaphor highlights the importance of
   shared syntax.
3. *Programming vs. Natural Languages*: Programming languages have
   stricter and more formal syntax rules compared to natural languages
   like English.
4. *Interpretation vs. Compilation*: Interpreted languages execute code
   directly, while compiled languages translate code into
   machine-readable object code before execution.
5. *What is a Program?* A program is a structured set of instructions,
   with components like input, output, and statements. Examples
   include baking recipes (pseudocode) and assembly programs.
6. *What is Debugging?* Debugging is identifying and fixing syntax
   errors, run-time errors, and logic errors through planning, coding,
   and testing.
7. *First Program*: "Hello, World!" serves as the starting point for
   programming in any language, demonstrating key steps like input,
   compilation, and execution.
8. *Tools and Environments*: Editors like `nano`, `Emacs`, and `vim`,
   along with tools like `gcc` and cloud platforms, support the
   programming process. Errors can occur at compile-time, run-time, or
   due to logic issues.
9. *Practice*: Practical exercises include writing, compiling, and
   running basic programs in Google Cloud Shell, focusing on
   understanding core programming workflows.
