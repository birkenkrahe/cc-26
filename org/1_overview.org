- How many programming languages are there?

- My first programming languages:
  + [[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7b/AtariBASIC.png][BASIC]] - Beginner's All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code (1979)
    #+attr_html: :width 400px :float nil:
    [[../img/AtariBASIC.png]]
  + FORTRAN - FORMula TRANslator (1985)
  + C++ - "C with classes" (1993)

- My last programming languages:
  + R - statistical programming language (2019)
  + Python - all-purpose programming language (2022)
  + Lisp - the first AI programming language (2024)

- Some languages that I picked up in between:
  + HTML/CSS - web layout (1991)
  + Shell - operating system control (1992)
  + SQL/SQLite - relational databases (2005)
  + Snap! - visual block-based coding (2020)

* The importance of infrastructure

We will take a "holistic", or complete view of computing:

The image shows eight layers that your computing infrastructure has to
manage (there are more in fact) - most of the software enabling you to
do this (without you noticing) is written in C.

*None of this is for you? Just learn C/C++ for the fun of it!*

* What will you do in this course?
#+attr_html: :width 300px:
#+caption: Durer, Angel playing lute (1497).
[[../img/durer_angel_playing_lute.jpg]]

You will learn to:
1) Reason - using *pseudocode* and the C/C++ programming language/s
2) Render - using an online *editor* set up for C programming
3) Run - using an online *command-line tool*

* Reason & run using pseudocode (BPMN)

Reason using pseudocode:
#+begin_quote
1. Open the BPMN online editor ([[https://bpmn.io][bpmn.io]])
2. Create a BPMN diagram
3. Pick a participant/process pool
4. Model a process using the BPMN language
5. Save model diagram as =.bpmn= or =.svg= file
#+end_quote

- Another nice way to produce flowcharts is with *Mermaid* (check out:
  mermaid.live):
  #+begin_src mermaid :file graph.png :cmdline "-b transparent -t dark"
    flowchart LR
       U["User<br>(standard input)"]
       O["Screen<br>(standard output)"]

       subgraph C["Computer"]
           direction LR
           S((Start))
           A["Include standard<br>input/output header file"]
           B["Define main program<br>without arguments"]
           D["Print string and<br>new line"]
           E["Return zero when<br>successful"]
           F((End))

           S --> A --> B --> D --> E --> F
    end

    U -.-> B
    D -.-> O
  #+end_src

* Render & run using OneCompiler

- Render and run code using OneCompiler
  #+begin_quote
  1. Open the OneCompiler dashboard ([[https://onecompiler.com/c][onecompiler.com/c]])
  2. Write source code in the editor panel (=Main.c=)
  3. Optionally, add input in the =STDIN= panel
  4. Compile & =RUN= code to see =Output= or an error report.

- Unexcused late submissions will be penalized (max. 50%).
- Optional oral final exam (sourced by term test questions).
- Programming assignments are (usually) home assignments.
- If you miss a class you can submit in-class assignments late.
- Tests are online, open book, multiple choice quizzes for home.
- Most test questions are reviewed in class before the test.

* Which platforms are we going to use?
#+attr_html: :width 600px:
#+caption: Durer, The Saints of Austria (1515)
[[../img/durer_six_saints_of_austria.jpg]]

All platforms are available online in the [Internet] cloud:

- *Canvas* (learning management system):
  1) Wiki-page with important links
  2) Mobile app for your phone
  3) Calendar for all assignments
  4) Zoom recordings of all classroom meetings
  5) Gradebook (up to date)
  6) Tests
  7) Announcements

- *GitHub* repo: [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/cc-26][github.com/birkenkrahe/cc-26]]
  1) Lectures, assignments, solutions (Org-mode)
  2) PDFs for lectures, assignments, solutions
  3) Images

- *Google Drive* (automatically tied to your Lyon email):
  1) Whiteboard screenshots
  2) Large files for sharing (videos, papers)
  3) Automatically saved Google Colab notebooks - [[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Pe1jRAvMpCPkYo0pwBbrfepOWU08kkEI?usp=sharing][Example]]

- *Google Chat Space* (you should be a member already):
  1) Motivational stuff
  2) Videos, books, articles
  3) Discussion with threads (use them!) - [[https://chat.google.com/room/AAAAIk8SqZE/uvO9-6ZgQdQ/uvO9-6ZgQdQ?cls=10][Example]]

- *OneCompiler* (register with Lyon email to keep your stuff)
  1) Assignments (download from there, upload to Canvas)
  2) Code along (during lectures and practice sessions)
  3) Code on your own (for example during open-book tests)

- *Google Cloud Shell*: at ~ide.cloud.google.com~. Open the ~terminal~. Here
  you can open and edit files with the simple ~nano~ editor, compile and
  run them with the ~gcc~ compiler. We'll practice that soon.

- *Go native Linux:* An alternative to Windows on Windows is to activate
  *WSL* (Windows Subshell for Linux), or install *Cygwin*, or use an IDE
  like *Code::Blocks*. On MacOS, you've (almost) got Unix already but
  you need to install stuff (~homebrew~ package manager).

* Bonus: Linux + Emacs + Org-mode (for extra credit)

- If you're interested in learning and using Linux and Emacs with
  Org-mode: Bring your laptop to my office hours to install Linux
  and/or Emacs (the editor that I'm using): [[https://tinyurl.com/sp26-booking][tinyurl.com/sp26-booking]]:

  1) Get WSL (Windows Subsystem Linux) on Windows 10 or Windows 11.
  2) Get the Emacs editor with my =.emacs= configuration.
  3) Write and run C programs inside the Emacs editor.

- Why would you do this?

  1) Linux is an environment that works for, and not against, the
     programmer. It's the most successful operating system (OS) on
     Earth. It's the OS for professionals everywhere.
  2) Using Emacs you can code along in the sessions a lot more
     effortlessly, and because Emacs is the hacker's editor par
     excellence & teaches you a lot more than raw editing.

- If you book a 30 min session with me to install Linux, and/or
  another session to install/learn Emacs, you get extra credit.

- If you already installed Linux, I can also help you become
  productive with it - a 30 minute session will achieve that.

* What did you just learn?

[[../img/durer_madonna_mit_dem_kind.jpg]]

Review for yourself what you remember, then let's check:

#+begin_quote
1. That there are many (easy to learn) programming languages.
2. That Lyon CS and DS graduates get cool jobs fast.
3. That you'll have to read, code and run C programs.
4. How you'll be graded for your coursework.
5. Which online platforms we're going to use.
#+end_quote

The following quote illustrates my own teaching style, too:
#+begin_quote
"I try to say everything at least three times: first, to introduce it;
second, to show it in context; and third, to show it in a different
context, or to review it." (Robert Chassell)
#+end_quote

You find up to date stuff on GitHub in the =agenda.org= file: Check it
out at: [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/cc-26/][github.com/birkenkrahe/cc-26]]
1) Weekly updates (housekeeping, assignments, tests)
2) Preview/review of reading assignments and tests
3) Links to practice labs and code along files

* First assignment... and assignment stress.

- The first assignment is to read the first chapter, "The Way of the
  Program" in the free online textbook Think C (copy:
  [[https://tinyurl.com/think-c-book][tinyurl.com/think-c-book]]) - 8 pages of text + glossary +
  exercises. You don't have to do the exercises! *BY THE NEXT CLASS*!

- This is not a graded assignment but the first test of 30 (!)
  multiple choice questions will mostly be based on this chapter. We
  might do the test in class next week as a popquiz.

- There will be ca. 10 of these 30-50 multiple-choice home tests in
  the term, and number of surprise pop-quizzes to solve in class.

- Don't stress yourself over any particular assignment: there are over
  50 assignments and tests in this course, and each assignment weighs
  5-50 points (altogether almost 1,000 points). That's your XP!

* Glossary

Computer Science is riddled with terminology. This is just from today,
and we'll probably add 20-30 new terms every week. Don't be put off by
that: Most of these can (and should) be looked up when needed. I'll
let you know in no uncertain terms when you need to memorize anything.
