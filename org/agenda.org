** DONE How to work with AI - three examples

- To compile this glossary, I copied the transcript of the video into
  a ChatGPT conversation and asked for the glossary using this prompt:

  #+begin_example
  You are given the transcript of a short introductory video about the
  C programming language.

  Task:
  1. Extract glossary terms that are explicitly mentioned in the transcript.
  2. Create a glossary table with three columns: a running number, the term,
     and a short explanation.
  3. Explanations should be concise (one short sentence), suitable for beginners.
  4. Do not introduce concepts that are not directly stated in the transcript.
  5. Use Org-mode table formatting.
  6. Keep wording simple and faithful to the video.

  Output only the glossary table in a code verbatim window, nothing else.
  #+end_example

- To produce this poster and the slides that you can find in GitHub, I
  used the Syllabus and my first overview lecture with NotebookLM:
  #+attr_html: :width 400px :float nil:
  [[../img/1_overview_poster.png]]
 
- I also used NotebookLM to produce a set of flashcards from the
  lecture. This would be a good way to study difficult material - less
  computer science (little to memorize) but history for example.
  #+attr_html: :width 300px :float nil:
  [[../img/flashcardFront.png]]  [[../img/flashcardBack.png]]

- We will explore this more as soon as we get into coding.

- You should start your own NotebookLM, fill it with sources from the
  course and use the different available tools.

** DONE What to do before/after class
#+attr_html: :width 400px :float nil:
[[../img/1_mastery.png]]

- This is what I do after class (as soon as I'm home):

  1) I extract 5-10 review questions from the lecture, the whiteboard
     screenshots, the practice, and from my memory.

  2) I write the review questions down and try to find answers. This
     is how we will start the next session.

  3) I let AI draft a multiple choice quiz from all the material
     discussed or looked at (for the next online test).

- This is what I do (right) before the next class (still at home):

  1) I try to answer the review questions myself without looking at
     the answers.

  2) I look at the whiteboard screenshots to remember what we
     did. Sometimes I have to look at the session recording.

  3) I check the Google chat to see if I missed any interesting post.

- Since you're not teaching this class you don't have to do exactly
  this, but you need to make sure to check your understanding (in
  whatever tiny way) both not too long after the last, and not too
  close to the next session.

** TODO Review

1. Are all problems computational problems?
   #+begin_quote
   No. Only problems that can be precisely described and solved by a
   step-by-step procedure are computational.
   #+end_quote

2. Is Computer Science actually a science? What's a science?
   #+begin_quote
   Yes and no. A science is a systematic study that builds and tests
   explanations; computer science studies computation, algorithms, and
   information systematically.

   At the same time, it's very young (< 100 years compared to math or
   physics > 2,500 years) and in practice resembles a craft or an art
   more than a science.
   #+end_quote

3. What's GitHub?
   #+begin_quote
   GitHub is an online platform for storing, sharing, and
   collaborating on code using version control.
   #+end_quote

4. How many (reserved) words does C have compared to English?
   #+begin_quote
   C has only a few dozen reserved words (roughly 30), while English
   has hundreds of thousands of words.
   #+end_quote

5. What is "NotebookLM"? What can you use it for?
   #+begin_quote
   NotebookLM is an AI tool that works with your own documents to
   generate summaries, flashcards, questions, and explanations.
   #+end_quote
