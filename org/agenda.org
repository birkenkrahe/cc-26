- Work through the material using the recording

** Review (Overview)

- When you hear the question, try to think of an answer.
- When you hear my answer(s), compare yours with mine.
- Sometimes my answers will contain additional information.
- Ask if anything is unclear this second time round.

1. What are the parts of our online programming environment?
   #+attr_html: :width 300px:
   [[../img/onecompiler2.png]]

2. Which online platforms are we going to use (know at least 2):
   #+begin_quote
   1) Canvas (learning management system)
   2) GitHub (lectures)
   3) Google Drive (whiteboard)
   4) Google Space (discussion)
   5) OneCompiler (programming)
   #+end_quote

3. What is "pseudocode"?
   #+begin_quote
   Instructions without syntax rules.
   #+end_quote
   Example:
   #+begin_example
   Start the program
   Count to 10
   Print number
   End the program
   #+end_example
   #+attr_html: :width 400px:

4. What does a typical "computing infrastructure" include?
   #+begin_quote
   1) An Operating system (like Windows or Linux) to do anything.
   2) Files to save source files (like =hello.c=).
   3) A Shell (or command-line) like =bash= to pass commands to the OS
   4) An editor to write, debug and save source code files.
   5) A network (like the Internet) for cloud applications.
   #+end_quote

5. What sits at the heart of the computer and what does it do?
   #+begin_quote
   At the heart of the computer sits the kernel program juggling
   thousands of system and user processes simultaneously while
   maintaining the illusion (for you) that it is only there for you.
   #+end_quote

6. How will you be evaluated in this class?
   #+begin_quote
   1) 50% for your programming assignments.
   2) 25% for your tests.

- [X] Compiling with onecompiler.com
- [X] Uploading an in-class assignment
- [X] Assignments for next week

** Review/Test preview (Way of the Program)

- The review questions are related to one or more questions on the
  weekly tests. In this case they come from the chapter you just read.

-----

1. What's the difference between interpreted and compiled languages?
   Examples for such languages?
   #+begin_comment
   /Interpreted/ languages (like Python) go straight from /source code/ to
   result, while /compiled/ languages (like C++) require an intermediate
   step, machine or /object/ code, before they can be run.
   #+end_comment

2. Who does what with what until a C program can be run?
   #+begin_comment
   1) The /user/ write /source code/ in an /editor/.
   2) The user saves the source code in a =.c= file.
   3) The /compiler/ translates the =.c= file into object code (=a.out=)
   4) The /shell/ executes the program.
   #+end_comment

3. What is the anatomy (dissection) of this command: =printf("Hello\n");=
   #+begin_comment
   1) =printf= is a function defined in the =<stdio.h>= header file.
   2) The function argument is a string ="..."=.
   3) The string consists of a /string literal/ (constant) =Hello= and a
   new line character, =\n=.
   4) The command is delimited by a =;= character.
   #+end_comment

4. Which programming errors do you know, when do they occur, and do
   you have an example?
   #+begin_comment
   1) /Syntax errors/ when the language rules are violated, for example
   a missing semicolon - program will not compile.
   2) /Logical errors/ when your algorithm does not work, for example
   the wrong formula - program will not crash.
   3) /Run-time errors/ when the program is executed - for example when
   you divide by zero - program crashes or behaves unexpectedly.
   4) /Semantic error/ when program compiles and runs but produces
   incorrect results due to incorrect meaning - for example, using
   a variable incorrectly.

   *Exercise: write little programs that produce each of these errors.*
   #+end_comment

5. Explain the structure of a typical C program.
   #+begin_src C
     // preprocessing: include header files for input/output
     #include <stdio.h>

     // main program:
     int main(void)
     {
       // action
       puts("Hello");
       // confirm success
       return 0;
     }
   #+end_src

6. What is "parsing"?
   #+begin_comment
   Analyzing the structure of a program - e.g. finding =main= to mark
   the beginning of the program, or =printf= to begin printing.
   #+end_comment

7. Does C code have to be indented like this to work?
   #+begin_src C
     int main()
     {
       float pi = 3.14;
       printf("%.2f",pi);
     }
   #+end_src

8. Do you always have to have a =main= program?
   #+begin_comment
   Yes.
   #+end_comment

9. What's debugging?
   #+begin_center
   Finding and fixing programming mistakes. Helpful: using a debugging
   program like =gdb= ("GNU Debugger") that allows you to step through
   the code to print intermediate results.
   #+end_center

10. Which program translates human-readable source code into
    machine-executable object code?
    #+begin_center
    =gcc= - the GNU C Compiler.
    #+end_center

** Assignments of the week

1. Complete a simple extension of the "hello world" program: Comment
   every line of the program and upload the URL to Canvas (Monday)

2. Read the second chapter (Variables and Types): 8 pages (you'll be
   tested on the content in test 2 at the end of the week - Friday).

3. There are two bonus assignments, which you can tackle at any point
   between now and May 9 (last day of class). One is simple, the other
   one is not so simple.

[[../img/t1_hist.png]]

- Four students missed the deadline!? (->  Max 50%)

- Good, almost excellent average! (89.44%)

- Code to draw the diagram shown (6 lines in R):
  #+begin_example R
  ## Variables
  t1 <- c(15,18,18,24,25,26,rep(27,3),rep(28,4),rep(29,5),rep(30,6))
  t1_normal <- t1/30 * 100
  t1_mean = mean(t1_normal)
  t1_mean_fmt <- as.numeric(format(t1_mean,digits=4))
  ## Plot
  hist(t1_normal,
       main="CSC 100: Test 1 (N=24)",
       xlab="Percentage",
       ylab="Number of participants",
       col="mistyrose")

         legend=paste("Average:",t1_mean_fmt,"%"),
         lty=1,lwd=3,
         col="red")
  #+end_example

** Review/Test preview: Introduction

1. What are the current assignments? How can you find out?
   #+attr_html: :width 700px:
   [[../img/calendar.png]]

   - The next assignment is test 2 (Friday, 31 January, 9 am).

   - The test is based on chapter 2 of the handout (Think C).

   - The next programming assignment is also due on Friday.

2. Which language has more rules and more words - C or English?
   #+begin_quote
   C has hundreds of clear rules collected in a few hundred pages of
   documentation, and only 30 reserved words.

   English has thousands of constantly evolving rules of grammar,
   spelling, pronunciation, and style, and hundreds of thousands of
   words.
   #+end_quote

3. What is =\n= called, and what does it do?
   #+begin_quote
   =\n= is an "escape character" that escapes the =n= using the =\=.

   When the machine sees =\n= it prints a new line.
   #+end_quote

4. When you type =main= in the editor, what does the machine see?
   #+begin_example
   The machine sees a sequence of ASCII characters that correspond to
   a binary stream (bits):

   m: ASCII code = 109, binary = 01101101
   a: ASCII code = 97, binary = 01100001
   i: ASCII code = 105, binary = 01101001
   n: ASCII code = 110, binary = 01101110
   #+end_example

   #+begin_src C :results table
     printf("%c %c %c %c\n",'m','a','i','n');
     printf("%i %i %i %i\n",'m','a','i','n');
     printf("%b %b %b %b\n",'m','a','i','n');
   #+end_src

5. What are the three main elements of computer architecture?
   #+attr_html: :width 500px:
   #+Caption: Central Processing Unit, Random Access Memory, Non Volatile Memory
   [[../img/computer_architecture.png]]

6. What's the main problem of computer architecture?
   #+Caption: The CPU is super-fast, the RAM is fast, and the NVM is very slow
   #+attr_html: :width 500px:
   [[../img/computer_architecture2.png]]

7. What does "tokenizing" mean?
   #+begin_quote
   "Tokenizing" means breaking down a sequence of text into smaller
   units called "tokens". In programming, these are the smallest
   elements of the source code that have meaning, such as keywords
   (e.g. =main=, =printf=), operators (=+=, ===), and punctuation =(;, {)=.
   #+end_quote

8. What's an IDE?
   #+begin_quote
   IDE = Integrated Development Environment - an application that
   integrates the editor, the compiler, and the shell so that you can
   write, compile and execute programs without leaving the app.

   Example: Emacs + Org-mode, or Onecompiler.com.
   #+end_quote

9. What is pseudocode?
   #+begin_quote
   Code in prose that encodes only the program logic and the program
   flow, but that does not comply with the syntax rules of any
   programming languages. A flowchart is pseudocode with graphics.
   #+end_quote

10. What is "Syntax highlighting"?
    #+begin_quote
    Syntax highlighting shows programming language syntax elements in
    different colors and/or fonts. Very helpful for writing/debugging
    code.
    #+end_quote

11. What should your source code include?
    #+begin_quote
    A program header with program name, input, output, author, date
    and license information.
    #+end_quote

12. What happens  if you  assign a  string value  like "Hello"  to an
    integer variable?
    #+begin_src C :tangle ../src/test.c
      int x;
      x = "Hello";
    #+end_src
    #+begin_quote
    - You can try this best in pythontutor (unless you have Emacs).
    - I will show you both pythontutor and the manual way.
    #+end_quote

** Review - printing with =%s=

1. What is ="%s %s"= ?
   #+begin_quote
   Two format specifiers waiting for two string values, for example
   ="Hello"= and ="World"=.
   #+end_quote

2. What's the difference between =%s%s\n= and =%s %s \n= ?
   #+begin_quote
   =%s%s\n= prints two strings without a space followed by a new line.

   =%s %s \n= prints two strings with a space between them followed by a
   space followed by a new line.
   #+end_quote

3. How many ways are there to print two words on two lines?

   #+begin_quote
   Many. You saw at least three.
   #+end_quote

   #+begin_src C :results output :includes <stdio.h>
     // print with `puts` (newline included)
     puts("Hello,");
     puts("world!\n");
     // Print two strings, one call, newline in the format part
     printf("%s\n%s", "Hello,", "world!");
     // Print one string per call
     printf("\n\n%s", "Hello");
     printf("\n%s", "world");
     // Print one string, newline in the value part
     printf("\n\n%s", "Hello\nworld!");
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   #+begin_example
   Hello,
   world!

   Hello,
   world!

   Hello
   world

   Hello
   world!
   #+end_example

4. You want to print five numbers. How many format specifiers do you
   need?
   #+begin_quote
   Five - one for each number.
   #+end_quote
   #+begin_src C
     // Print five integer values
     printf("%i %i %i %i %i\n", 0, 1, 2, 3, 4);
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : 0 1 2 3 4

5. How many arguments does =printf= accept?
   #+begin_quote
   As many as it takes & as much memory as there is available.
   The general form is:
   printf( [format string], [arguments] );
   #+end_quote

** Printing formatted values (in-class practice with upload)

** Test 1 deadline is this Friday (11:59 pm)!

- First results look promising!
- Take your merry time with the test!
- When asked about code, try it out!

** Assignment review: Hello world program with comments

- *Puzzled:* Many of you did not follow the instructions!? (AVG=8.76)

- *Note*: Instructions are everything, creativity means nothing.

- *Always ask* if you're unsure or confused. I'm here to help!

- *Review questions*:

  1) What does the program header contain?
     #+begin_quote
     Program name, purpose, input, output, author, pledge, date
     #+end_quote
  2) What does the function header contain?
     #+begin_quote
     Function name, return type, parameters (function arguments)
     #+end_quote
  3) What would the function header for this function look like?
     #+begin_example C
       void hello(char name) {
         printf("Hello, Mr. %c!", name);
       }
     #+end_example

     #+begin_src C :results output
       // hello: print a greeting and a character
       // returns: nothing (void)
       // parameters: character `name`
       void hello(char name) {
         printf("Hello, Mr. %c!", name);
       }
       int main(){
         hello('X');
         return 0;
       }
     #+end_src

     #+RESULTS:
     : Hello, Mr. X!
  4) What exactly happens in =printf("Hello, world.\n");=
     #+begin_example C
     // function `printf` is called
     // string "Hello, world." is printed
     // escape character `\n` moves cursor to next line
     // statement is closed with the delimiter `;`
     #+end_example
  5) Where should one put meta data like headers and comments?
     #+begin_quote
     - All meta data are placed ahead of what they're accompanying
     - Headers are placed immediately before functions
     - Comments =//= or =/* */= are placed immediately before or next to
       what they' commenting upon.
     #+end_quote

     #+begin_src C
       // hello: Print greeting
       // Returns: nothing (void)
       // Parameters: none (void)
       void hello(void) {
         puts("Hello.");
       }

       /*
        ,*   main program
        ,*/
       int main(void)
       {

         hello(); // call function

         return 0;
       }
     #+end_src

** Review (last lecture)

1. What's wrong with this code?
   #+begin_src C
     printf(%s\n, "Hello");
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : Hello

   #+begin_quote
   The format string =%s\n= is not formatted as a string.

   Syntax error. Correct: =printf("%s\n", "Hello");=
   #+end_quote

2. What's wrong with this code?
   #+begin_src C :results output
     puts("I am %i years old", 22);
     puts("I am 22 years old");
     printf("I am %i years old", 22);
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : I am %i years old
   : I am 22 years old
   : I am 22 years old

   #+begin_quote
   The =puts= function only prints a string + a new line.

   Logic error. Correct: =puts("I am 22 years old");=
   #+end_quote

3. What's wrong with this code?
   #+begin_src C :tangle main.c :includes <stdio.h>
     void main()
     {
       puts("");
     }
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:

   #+begin_quote
   The =main= function must =return= an =int=, not =void=.

   Run-time error. Correct: =int main() { puts(""); return 0;}=
   #+end_quote

4. What's wrong with this code?
   #+begin_src C
     printf("I have %c\n", "character.");
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : I have 

   #+begin_quote
   A string argument is provided but a character argument is expected.

   Type mismatch error. Correct: =printf("I have %s\n", "character.");=
   #+end_quote

5. What's wrong with this code?
   #+begin_src C  :tangle main2.c :includes <stdio.h>
     printf("%i + %i = %i \n", 224);
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : 224 + 1768136904 = -1361404480

   #+begin_quote
   One integer argument is provided but three are expected.

   Run-time error. Correct: =printf("%i + %i = %i \n", 2, 2, 4);=

** Review of the last lecture - Integer types

1. What's wrong with this code?
   #+begin_src C
     height = 10;
     int height;
   #+end_src
   #+begin_quote
   The variable =height= is used before it is declared.
   #+end_quote

2. What's wrong with this code?
   #+begin_src C
     int main(void) {
       int height;
       printf("The height is %d\n", height);
       return 0;
     }
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : The height is 0

   #+begin_quote
   The variable =height= is uninitialized, so its value is undefined.
   #+end_quote

3. What's wrong with this code?
   #+begin_src C
     8 = height;
   #+end_src
   #+begin_quote
   Literals like =8= cannot be assigned values because they are
   constants.
   #+end_quote

4. What's wrong with this multi-variable declaration/definition?
   #+begin_src C
     int height = 3, width = 2, volume
   #+end_src
   #+begin_quote
   The statement is missing a semicolon (=;=).
   #+end_quote

5. What's wrong with this variable reassignment?
   #+begin_src C
     int main(void) {
       int foo;
       foo = 8;
       int foo = 18;
       return 0;
     }
   #+end_src
   #+begin_quote
   A variable cannot be redeclared within the same scope.
   #+end_quote

** Review of the in-class programming practice
#+attr_html: :width 400px:
#+caption: To the AI, nerds are always insanely attractive
[[../img/coding_couple.png]]

- 50% of you did not get the correct result. That's not a surprise!

- I've written to you with some recommendation:

  1. *Check* the instructions and try to write the code again in your
     own time.
  2. Even if it works, *compare* it with my sample solution.
  3. *Fix* the errors, try again until you have a working solution that
     you wrote yourself (= with your own hands).
  4. Now go back to your original (failed) program and make sure that
     you *understand* what you did wrong, and what every line means.
  5. You could go crazy and read the program again from the bottom
     line proceeding from right to left.

If after this you're still in need of tutoring: *come by my office*
(book at: [[https://tinyurl.com/sp25-booking][tinyurl.com/sp25-booking]])!  We'll sort you out in 30 min!

There's no shame in failing at coding at this stage but you need to
work at it a little at least to keep your head above water.

It'll do to check out the lectures and the code before/after class and
spend enough time on the programing assignments & perhaps try a bonus.

** Where can I get more practice problems?

1. Make up your own problems by minimally changing the programs that
   you wrote or that you saw in class.
2. Use AI: Paste the last program that you successfully wrote yourself
   into the interface, confess to being a complete noob and beginner &
   ask for 5 similar problems (without solutions).
3. Check out the "Challenges" tab in OneCompiler.com
4. Ask me.
5. More challenging: Go to leetcode.com and look for beginner problems
   in C.

** Review of the last lecture - Floating point types

1. What's wrong with this assignment? Will it compile? Will it run?
   #+begin_src C
     float profit = 2150.48;
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:

   #+begin_quote
   What's wrong?
   - Yes, it will compile and run.
   - The floating-point literal =2150.48= is a =double= by default.
   - While it can still be assigned to a =float=, this may cause
     implicit *type conversion* issues.
   - To explicitly indicate a =float=, the =f= suffix should be used.
   #+end_quote

2. What's wrong with this assignment? Will it compile? Will it run?
   #+begin_src C
     int iProfit = 2150.48;
   #+end_src
   #+begin_quote
   What's wrong?
   - Yes, it will compile and run.
   - A floating-point number is being assigned to an integer.
   - The compiler does not warn about this, but it will truncate the
     decimal portion.
   - =iProfit= will store =2150=, not =2150.48=, which may lead to
     unexpected results.
   #+end_quote

3. How can you show what's wrong with the last assignment?
   #+begin_src C
     int iProfit = 2150.48;  // wrong assignment
     printf("iProfit = %i or is it %f?\n", iProfit, (float)iProfit);
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : iProfit = 2150 or is it 2150.000000?

   #+begin_quote
   - You have to print the memory content.
   - This shows that the fractional part of =iProfit= is lost forever.
   #+end_quote

4. What's wrong with this formatted output? What will it print?
   #+begin_src C
     float half = 0.5 * 10.0;
     printf("Half the number is: %i\n", half);
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : Half the number is: 1074283832

   #+begin_quote
   What's wrong?
   - The format specifier =%i= is for integers, but =half= is a =float=.
   - Using =%i= for a floating-point value results in *undefined behavior*.
   - The correct format specifier should be =%f= instead.
   #+end_quote

5. What's wrong with this code?
   #+begin_src C
     int height = 8, length = 12, width = 10;
     printf("Volume = %i\n", height + length + width);
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : Volume = 30

   #+begin_quote
   What's wrong?
   - The calculation inside =printf= is incorrect.
   - Instead of multiplying =height=, =length=, and =width=, the code mistakenly adds them.
   - The correct computation should be =height * length * width=.
   - Don't be so focused on the language that you forget math & logic!
   #+end_quote

6. What's wrong with this program? Will it compile? Will it run?
   #+begin_src C :results output
     #include <stdio.h>

     int main(void)
     {
       int num = 10;
       int doubleNum = 2 * num;
       float half = 0.5 * num;

       printf("The number is: %i\nDouble the number is: %i\nHalf the number is: %f",
              num, doubleNum, half);
     }
   #+end_src
   #+begin_quote
   What's wrong?
   - Yes it will compile (usually) and run.
   - The =main= function is missing a =return 0;= statement at the end.
   - While some compilers allow this omission, returning 0 explicitly
     indicates successful execution.
   - Best practice is to include =return 0;= at the end of =main=.
   #+end_quote

7. What's wrong with this code - why won't it compile?
   #+begin_src C :includes <stdio.h> :results output
     int num = 10;
     int doubleNum = 2 * num;
     float half = 0.5 * num;

     printf("The number is: %i\n\
     Double the number is: %i\nHalf the number is: %f",
            num,
            doubleNum,
            half);
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : The number is: 10
   : Double the number is: 20
   : Half the number is: 5.000000

   #+begin_quote
   What's wrong?
   - The formatting string is not finished (error message: ="missing
     terminating character"=) - to extend a string over a new line, you
     need to terminate it with a ~\~.
   - The syntax highlighting already reveals that something's not
     right.
   #+end_quote

** Review of the last lecture

1. What's wrong with this code? Will it compile? Will it run?

   #+begin_src C
     #define PI 3.141593;
     printf("Pi is %f\n", PI);
   #+end_src

   #+begin_quote
   - It won't compile.
   - The semicolon (=;=) at the end of =#define PI 3.141593;= is incorrect.
   - Macro definitions are not *statements*; they are simple *text
     substitutions*. The semicolon will be included in every
     replacement, causing a *syntax error* when used in expressions.
   #+end_quote

2. What's wrong with this code? Will it compile? Will it run?

   #+begin_src C :results output
     #define VALUE 1.0
     printf("Constant value is %.1f\n", VALUE);
     #define VALUE 2.0
     printf("Constant value is %.1f\n", VALUE);
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : Constant value is 1.0
   : Constant value is 2.0

   #+begin_quote
   - The code compiles and runs.
   - The constant =VALUE= is redefined using =#define= without an =#undef=
     directive.
   - While this is allowed in C, it generates a compiler warning.
   - Redefining a macro without =#undef= can lead to unexpected
     behavior. A proper approach is:
   #+end_quote
   #+begin_src C
     #define VALUE
     // ...
     #undef VALUE
     #define VALUE 2.0
   #+end_src

3. What's wrong with this code? Will it compile? Will it run?

   #+begin_src C
     #include <stdio.h>
     printf("Pi is %f\n", M_PI); // M_PI is the mathematical constant \pi
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:

   #+begin_quote
   - Program will not compile.
   - The program is missing the =#include <math.h>= header, which
     defines =M_PI=.
   - Without this, the compiler does not recognize =M_PI=, leading to an
     "undeclared identifier" error.
   #+end_quote

4. What's wrong with this code? Will it compile? Will it run?

   #+begin_src C
     #include <stdio.h>
     #define apple_pie M_PI

     int main(void) {
       printf("Pi is %f\n", apple_pie);
       return 0;
     }
   #+end_src

   #+begin_quote
   - It will not compile.
   - The program is missing =#include <math.h>=, which defines
     =M_PI=. Since =apple_pie= is defined as =M_PI=, but =M_PI= is not
     recognized, the program will fail to compile.
   #+end_quote

5. What's wrong with this code? Will it compile? Will it run?
   #+begin_src C :main no :includes
     #include <stdio.h>
     #include <math.h>
     #define e M_E
     printf("%.16f\n", e);
     int main() {

       return 0;
     }
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:

   #+begin_quote
   - It will not compile.
   - The =printf= statement is outside a function. In C, all executable
     statements must be inside a function, typically =main()=.
   #+end_quote

** New programming assignment "Your height in light-years"

- Define physics constants (speed of light, year in seconds).

- Convert height (in meters) into light-years (the distance that
  photons travel in the course of one year).

- You can use the formula: $$ 1 [m] \equiv \frac{1}{c [m/s] \times y [s]} $$
  where $c$ is the speed of light, and $y$ is the year in seconds.

- For example, the Eifeltower in Paris is 330 m high. In light-years:
  #+begin_src C
    printf("%.2E", 330/(299792458.0 * 31536000.0)); // using the %e format
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : 3.49e-14

- To avoid having to print 1/3.49049200000000, the =printf= statement
  uses scientific or E-notation with the =%e= format specifier.

- *Remember*: You must reproduce the sample output exactly, you must
  respect the constraints, and you must adequatly comment your code.

- The *bonus* assignment is a reloaded version, which will include
  accepting keyboard input to compute the height in light-years.

*Questions:*

1. How can you print =6.5%=?
   #+begin_src C
     printf("6.5%%\n"); // escape `%` with `%`
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : 6.5%

2. How can you print =2.7182818285= as =2.71=?
   #+begin_src C
     printf("%.2f\n",2.7182818285); // retain two digits only
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : 2.72

3. How can you define a permanent constant?
   #+begin_src C
     const int perm = 1;  // this is what you saw in class
     int const perm2 = 2; // you can swap `const` and `int`

     printf("%i %i\n",perm,perm2);
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : 1 2

4. What is =stdin=? How can you get it in C++?
   #+begin_quote
   =stdin= stands for "standard input" = incoming data, for example from
   a keyboard, or a touchscreen, or a camera.

   You can fetch standard input with the =scanf= function.
   #+end_quote

5. How would you fetch =100= from the keyboard and store it in =x=?
   #+begin_src C :cmdline < 100
     int x;   // first declare an integer variable
     scanf("%i",&x);  // get the value from the keyboard
     printf("%i\n",x); // print what you got
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : 100

** Wrong test 5 question

This turned out to be tricky! Everybody who did the test by Friday got
1 extra point & James got 2 points for discovering the mistake first.

1) *Question:* How can you print *2.7182818285* as *2.71* in C?
   - [X] `printf("%.2f\n", 2.7182818285);`
   - [ ] `printf("%.3f\n", 2.7182818285);`
   - [ ] `printf("%0.2lf\n", 2.7182818285);`
   - [ ] `printf("%.2lf\n", 2.7182818285);`

2) Solution: The question was ill-posed because ~printf~ *rounds* unless
   explictly instructed to *truncate*.
   #+begin_src C :results output
     #include <stdio.h>

     int main() {
       double num = 2.7182818285; // `double`: `long` %lf
       printf("%.2f\n", num);     // precision 2 - rounds
       printf("%0.2lf\n", num);   // precision 2 - rounds
       printf("%.2lf\n", num);    // precision 2 - rounds
       printf("%.3f\n", num);     // precision 3 - rounds
       printf("%.2f\n", (int) (num * 100)/100.0); // truncated
       return 0;
     }
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : 2.72
   : 2.72
   : 2.72
   : 2.718
   : 2.71

3) Explanation:

   - Multiplication by 100 shifts the decimal point to the right:
     #+begin_src C
       float num = 2.7182818285;
       printf("Shift %f to the right: %f\n",num, num * 100);
     #+end_src

     #+RESULTS:
     : Shift 2.718282 to the right: 271.828186

   - Cast with ~(int)~ removes the decimal part (truncates it):
     #+begin_src C :results output
       float num = 2.7182818285;
       printf("Shift %f to the right: %f\n",num, num * 100);
       printf("Truncate %f: %d\n",num * 100, (int) (num * 100));
     #+end_src

     #+RESULTS:
     : Shift 2.718282 to the right: 271.828186
     : Truncate 271.828186: 271

   - Division by 100 shifts it back by two places:
     #+begin_src C :results output
       float num = 2.7182818285;
       printf("Shift %f to the right: %f\n",num, num * 100);
       printf("Truncate %f: %d\n",num * 100, (int) (num * 100));
       printf("Shift %d back: %.2f\n",(int) (num * 100), (int)(num*100)/100.0);
     #+end_src

     #+RESULTS:
     : Shift 2.718282 to the right: 271.828186
     : Truncate 271.828186: 271
     : Shift 271 back: 2.71

2. How do humans vs. machines solve problems?
   #+begin_quote
   - Humans: with *heuristics* ("tinkering" / "trial and error")
   - Machines: with *algorithms* (strict instruction sets)
   #+end_quote

3. What's a *unary operator*? Can you give an example?
   #+begin_quote
   - An operator (a built-in function) with one operand is "unary"
   - =NOT= (Boolean op.), =++= (compound op.), negation =-= (arithmetic op.)
   #+end_quote

4. What's the difference between ==== and === ? Can you give an example?
   #+begin_src C
     int x = 1;  // assignment operator
     printf("%d\n", x == x); // equality operator (conditional)
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : 1

5. When asked to "build a simple calculator", how should you proceed?
   #+begin_quote
   1) Start simple: one operation, fixed values.
   2) Variable declaration, computation, print result.
   3) Complete calculator for all remaining operations.
   4) Add user interface (keyboard input).
   5) Compile, run and test it again and again and again...
   #+end_quote

6. You compile a file called =amazing.c=. What's the output file called?
   #+begin_quote
   The standard output or *object* file is called =a.out=.
   #+end_quote

7. How can you run the executable file =a.out= on the command-line if
   you and the file are both in your home directory?
   #+begin_quote
   You have to give the computer the *path* to the file:
   1) =./a.out=             // relative path to =a.out=
   2) =/myHome/a.out=       // absolute path to =a.out=
   #+end_quote

8. What is the golden rule for the format string of ~scanf~?
   #+begin_quote
   The format string of ~scanf~ should be minimal, and contain only the
   format specifiers required for the input data types, e.g. ="%d%d"=
   requires you to enter two numbers like this: =11= and not =1 1=.
   #+end_quote

9. What is the rule for the arguments of ~scanf~?
   #+begin_quote
   Variables need to be declared with the *address-of* operator ~&~.
   #+end_quote

10. How many operators does C have?
    #+begin_quote
    C has 44 operators - arithmetic, relational, logical, bitwise,
    assignment, increment/decrement, conditional/ternary, comma,
    pointer, type casting, SizeOf, structure/member.
    #+end_quote


** *Lecture & Practice:* Operators (=++=, =*==, =&&=)

*Three types of operators:*
1) [X] arithmetic operators like ~*~
2) [X] logical and relational operators like ~==~ and ~<~
3) [ ] compound operators like ~++~ and ~+=~

In this session you produce 7 C files which in the end you
must upload as a ZIP file - if you miss a session, please
create the file on your own (ask me ask me ask me).

** NOT ~!~ question by Nichole (with a preview)

#+begin_quote
Does the operator ! convert the value of the operand to a binary value
and then act to reverse that value?
#+end_quote

​Yes, very good observation. Reverse = inverse.

#+begin_quote
If x=5, ! causes the machine to see the five as TRUE and returns the
reverse of that, so !x will return FALSE because what the machine
sees is NOT TRUE, i.e. !1?
#+end_quote

In C, all values except =0= are considered =TRUE= by the machine.

#+begin_src C :results output :main yes :includes <stdio.h>
  float truth[]={0,1,-100,3.14};  // Boolean array (collection)

  for (int i=0; i<4;i++) {  // for loop (iteration)
    if(truth[i])  // condition statement
      printf("%g is TRUE\n",truth[i]);
    else
      printf("%g is FALSE\n",truth[i]);
   }
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: 0 is FALSE
: 1 is TRUE
: -100 is TRUE
: 3.14 is TRUE

For your example: the =stdbool= header file allows you to define a data
type =bool= but C still only uses 1 and 0 internally for TRUE and FALSE.

#+begin_src C
  #include <stdbool.h>  // standard header file
  bool x = 5;
  printf("%d %d",x, !x); // 5 is TRUE and !5 = 0 is FALSE
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: 1 0

#+begin_quote
And if x=0, ! causes the machine to see the zero as FALSE so the
machine will return TRUE because what it sees is NOT FALSE, i.e. !0?
#+end_quote

#+begin_src C
  #include <stdbool.h>
  bool x = 0;
  printf("%d %d",x, !x); // 5 is TRUE and !5 = 0 is FALSE
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: 0 1

** Review: AND (~&&~), OR (~||~), NOT (~!~)

(Solution to =boolean.c=)

1. What is: (100 && 1) ? (Boolean operator AND)
   #+begin_src C
     printf("(100 && 1) is %d\n", 100 && 1);
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : (100 && 1) is 1

2. What is (100 || 0) ? (Boolean operator OR)
   #+begin_src C  :results output
     printf("(100 || 0) is %d\n", 100 || 0);
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : (100 || 0) is 1

3. What is (1 == 0) ? (Logical, not Boolean operator)
   #+begin_src C
     printf("(1 == 0) is %d\n", 1 == 0); // not assignment!
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : (1 == 0) is 0

4. What is !(-1) and !!10 ?
   #+begin_src C :results output
     printf("!(-1) is %d, !!(10) is %d\n", !(-1), !!10);
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : !(-1) is 0, !!(10) is 1

5. What is (1 < 0) || (0 < 1) ? (FALSE OR TRUE)
   #+begin_src C :results output
     printf("(1 < 0) || (0 < 1) is %d\n", (1 < 0) || (0 < 1));
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : (1 < 0) || (0 < 1) is 1

** Next programming assignments

Three simple assignments:
- Add and divide floating point numbers
- Compute Boolean expressions
- Compute compound operators

* DONE Week 8: Operators II
#+attr_html: :width 400px :float nil:
#+Caption: Jonah and the Whale by Pieter Lastman (1621)
[[../img/jonah.jpg]]

This week, we'll finish the basics, and we're moving on to bigger and
better things: conditional statements, iterations, data structures.

** New test - Command-line and Operators

This test covers our Google Cloud Shell exploration and the lecture
and practice on operators in C.

- 40 questions but lots of repetition (drill test).
- Take your time with it and use available sources.
- Hard deadline March 10 (because of midterms 12-Mar).

** Three simple programming assignments

The instructions for these exercises are way longer than the programs
themselves. They are simple because there's not much you can do by way
of programming without ~if-else~ statements, ~loops~ and ~arrays~.

- 6 Command-line floating-point calculator.
- 7 De Morgan's Law Demonstrator.
- 8 Number Change with Increment/Decrement.
- Hard deadline March 10 (because of midterms 12-Mar).
- Submission as URL in OneCompiler (b/c I must grade fast).
- You'll get sample solutions on March 11.

   #+end_example

5. How can you save the program and exit?
   #+begin_quote
   In nano: CTRL + S to save, CTRL + X to exit
   #+end_quote

6. How can you compile =program.c=, name the executable =pgm= and run it?
   #+begin_example sh
   gcc program.c -o pgm && ./pgmg
   #+end_example

7. How can you "Check if =i= OR =j= are both ~TRUE~" translate to C?
   #+begin_src C
     i || j
   #+end_src

8. How can you "Check if the input variable =letter= was entered as X"?
   #+begin_src C
     letter == 'X'
   #+end_src

9. How can you "Check if =i= is in the interval =(0,10]="
   #+begin_src
   0 < i && i <= 10
   #+end_src

10. How can you archive =p1.c= and =p2.c= and check the archive file?
    #+begin_example sh

* DONE Week 9: Control Flow - ~if~ / ~else~ / ~else if~
#+attr_html: :width 400px :float nil:
#+caption: Source: Cover of "Moby Dick" by Herman Melville
[[../img/mobydick.png]]

- [X] Beyond the basics: Roadmap to Happy Hunting
- [X] Pseudocode & Practice & Process diagrams
- [ ] Control flow keywords (if, else, else if, switch)

- [X] New programming assignment available
- [X] New script available (online only)
- [X] All programming assignments are open for late submission

** Beyond the basics

- What you've learnt so far: The *basics*
  1) Values & expressions
  2) Variables & constants
  3) Statements
  4) Operators

- The next step is: *Control* of the program flow
  1) Decisions (~if~, ~else~, ~else if,~ and ~switch~)
  2) Loops (~for~, ~while~, and ~do while~)
  3) Collections (arrays)
  4) Modules (functions)
  5) Memory (pointers)

- This leads us to *data structures* like
  1) Strings
  2) Structs
  3) Linked lists
  4) Trees
  5) Graphs

- Data structures are subject of CSC 240 (Fall'25).

** Continued: Pseudocode/if-else

- Open the starter code again (clean this time):

- Fix the program according to the pseudocode!

- Check that it works with the input "1 100" and "2 100".

- Then we'll move on.

** Review: Programming assignments

- For the "Command-line floating-point calculator" you actually had to
  enter command-line arguments (rather than static values).

- Many submissions for the "De Morgan's Law Demonstrator" looked
  correct but did not exactly reproduce the test output.

- For the "Number changer with increment/decrement" exercise, the
  following statement is undefined even though it may compile and run!
  #+begin_src C
    int number = -5;

    number == ++number;   // undefined state! Not correct!
    printf("%d\n",number);

  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : -4

- If you think that I made a mistake, you can still let me know after
  this class (by 11 am today).

- I reduced the grade impact from the programming assignments (40%)
  and increased the impact of the tests (35%). Final exam still 25%.

** Review: Pseudocode

1. *What is pseudocode?*
   #+begin_quote
   Pseudocode: Outline algorithm/heuristics without worrying about
   syntax. Write as C comments for insertion into source code.
   #+end_quote

2. *When should you use pseudocode?*
   #+begin_quote
   Always start with pseudocode before writing actual code to design
   solutions; revert to it when stuck (not due to syntax issues).
   #+end_quote

3. *What's Pólya’s problem-solving method?*
   #+begin_quote
   Pólya’s Heuristic Problem-Solving Method: Understand the problem,
   devise a plan, carry out the plan, and look back to verify/improve.
   #+end_quote

4. *Which example did we use for pseudocode?*
   #+begin_quote
   Practical Example: Game logic in Pseudocode. Shows how pseudocode
   mirrors problem descriptions. Use problem language as given.
   #+end_quote

5. *How do you transition from pseudocode to source code?*
   #+begin_quote
   Applying Pseudocode to Code: Fill in the bits first, then add error
   handling for everything that could possibly go wrong with input.
   #+end_quote

6. *Translate to pseudocode:*
   #+begin_quote
   "In a platform game, if an obstacle is high (above 5 units), the
   player should duck. If it’s low (5 units or less), the player
   should jump."
   #+end_quote
   #+begin_src C
     // If obstacle > 5
     // duck
     // If obstacle <= 5
     // jump
   #+end_src

7. *Translate this pseudocode to source code:*
   #+begin_src C
     // If obstacle > 5
     // duck
     // If obstacle <= 5
     // jump
   #+end_src
   #+begin_src C
     int obstacle = 7; // high; try 3 for low

     if (obstacle > 5) // If obstacle > 5
       puts("Duck!");
      else              // If obstacle <= 5
        puts("Jump!");

   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : Duck!

8. *Translate to pseudocode:*
   #+begin_quote
   "In an adventure game, if the player’s inventory has less than 10
   items, they can collect a treasure. If the inventory has 10 or more
   items, they must drop one."
   #+end_quote
   #+begin_src C
     // If inventory.items < 10
     // collect treasure
     // If inventory.items >= 10
     // drop item
   #+end_src

9. *Translate this pseudocode to source code:*
   #+begin_src C
     // If inventory items < 10
     // collect treasure
     // print inventory count
     // If inventory items >= 10
     // drop item
     // print inventory count
   #+end_src
   #+begin_src C :results output
     int items = 12; // test: change to 12 items

     if (items <10) { // If inventory items < 10
       items = items + 1; // collect treasure
       printf("Treasure collected. Inventory = %d\n", items);
      } else {       // If inventory items >= 10
       items = items - 1; // drop item
       printf("Item dropped. Inventory count: %d\n", items);
      }
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : Item dropped. Inventory count: 11

10. What's wrong with this pseudocode?
    #+begin_quote
    "In a combat game, if the player’s health is below 50, heal if
    mana is above 20. Otherwise, attack the enemy."
    #+end_quote
    #+begin_src C
      // if health < 50
      // if mana > 20
      // Heal
      // else
      // Attack
      // else
      // Heal
    #+end_src
    Correct version:
    #+begin_src C
      // if health < 50 AND mana > 20
      // Heal
      // else
      // Attack
    #+end_src
    Explanation:
    #+begin_quote
    - Let’s break it down:
      + *Condition:* ~if health < 50 AND mana > 20~ means both must be true to heal.
      + *Intent Match:* The problem says "if health is below 50, heal if
        mana is above 20," implying healing only occurs when *both*
        conditions are met (low health *and* enough mana). Your
        pseudocode aligns with this.
      + *Else Clause:* "Otherwise, attack" covers all other cases (e.g.,
        ~health >= 50~ or ~mana <= 20~), which matches the problem’s
        intent to attack when not healing.

    - *Test Cases:*
      - ~health = 40, mana = 30~: Health < 50 and mana > 20 →
        Heal. (Correct)
      - ~health = 40, mana = 10~: Health < 50 but mana <= 20 →
        Attack. (Correct)
      - ~health = 60, mana = 30~: Health >= 50 → Attack. (Correct)
      - ~health = 60, mana = 10~: Health >= 50 → Attack. (Correct)

** Popquiz

- Complete [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/cc-25/blob/main/pdf/popquiz.pdf][this popquiz (PDF)]] in 30 minutes or less.
- It is ungraded and only serves to aid your understanding.
- We will discuss the solution afterwards (also online).
- This quiz will make you fit for the next test (Mar 21).
- You can find the solution at [[https://tinyurl.com/if-popquiz][tinyurl.com/if-popquiz]].
- Important:
  1) Understand first, then plan, then execute, then evaluate (Polya)
  2) Your pseudocode is yours - it can be personal and different
  3) Stay away from C syntax if you can to get the logic clear first

** The ~switch~ and ~break~ commands

This lecture explores the ~switch~ statement in C, a powerful control
structure for handling multiple conditions.

- You'll learn how ~switch~ uses an integer expression to select from
  ~case~ labels—constant values triggering specific statements.

- The ~break~ keyword controls execution by exiting the ~switch~ block,
  preventing fall-through to subsequent cases unless omitted
  intentionally.

- Through *examples* and a *practice* exercise, we’ll cover its syntax,
  behavior, and practical applications, like /grading systems/ and /day
  classification/.

** IN-PROGRESS Loops / Control flow statements that iterate

- Collections of objects (like numbers, words) are usually stored
  efficiently in so-called /data structures/, e.g. /arrays/.

- There are three /control flow (aka looping) statements/ that allow you
  to /iterate/ over data:
  - [X] ~while~ loops
  - [ ] ~do while~ loops
  - [ ] ~for~ loops

- We'll cover them using the same approach, with practice:
  1) A simple example
  2) A counting example
  3) A summing example (home assignment)

** DONE Review: ~while~ loops

1. The ~while~ loop allows you to print numbers 0 to 9. True or false?

5. *Challenge!* What's the code to get a sequence of numbers from the
   keyboard if the end of the sequence is signalled by a =0= input?

   - Pseudocode:
     #+begin_example C
       // SET num to non-zero value
       // WHILE num is not zero
         // GET next value for num
         // PRINT num
      // END WHILE
      // PRINT "You're done."
     #+end_example

   - Code:
     #+begin_src C :tangle input.c :main yes :includes <stdio.h>
       int num=1; // SET num to non-zero value
       while (num != 0) { // WHILE num is not zero
         scanf("%d",&num);  // GET next value for num
         printf("You entered: %d.\n",num); // PRINT num
        } // END WHILE
       puts("You're done."); // PRINT "You're done."
     #+end_src

     int x = 0;
     do {
       printf("Counting: %d\n", x);
      } while (x > 0);

   #+begin_quote
   The loop runs only once because the condition =x > 0= is immediately
   =FALSE= since =x == 0= from the start. Either adjust the condition or
   increment =x= inside the loop.
   #+end_quote

2) What's wrong with this loop? It does not run at all.

       printf("Value: %d\n", i);
       i--;
      } while (i < 5);
   #+end_src

   #+begin_quote
   It runs infinitely because the =i--= decrements the initial value of
   =i= from =5= to =4=, and =i < 5= remains true forever.
   #+end_quote

4) What's wrong with this loop? It runs forever.
   #+begin_src C :main yes :includes <stdio.h> <stdlib.h> <string.h> :results output :exports both :noweb yes
     int count = 0;
     do {
       count++;
       printf("Count: %d\n", count);
      } while (count = 1);
   #+end_src

   #+begin_quote
   The break condition is ill-conceived: =count = 1= is not a comparison
   ~count==1~ but an assignment: =count= is always =1= (~TRUE~), irrespective
   of the former value of =count=.
   #+end_quote

5) What's wrong with this loop? It runs forever.
   #+begin_src C :main yes :includes <stdio.h> <stdlib.h> <string.h> :results output :exports both :noweb yes

       printf("Looping...\n");
      } while (x < 10);
     x++;

** DONE Review: ~for~ loops

*** ~for~ loops with post and pre operators.


1. =TRUE= or =FALSE=? These two loops have different outputs (as long as
   they have identical loop bodies) - explain your answer.
   #+begin_example C
   for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) ... // postfix operator i = i + 1
   for (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i) ... // prefix operator  i = i + 1
   #+end_example

   #+begin_quote
   =TRUE= because only the ~return~ value of the increment expression is
   used: =i++= is =i = i + 1=. They are semantically identical.
   #+end_quote

2. =TRUE= or =FALSE=? The two loops in this program have different
   outputs - explain your answer.
   #+begin_src C
     for (int i = 0; i++ < 5; ) printf("%d ",i); puts("");

   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : 1 2 3 4 5
   : 1 2 3 4

   #+begin_quote
   =TRUE= because the increment is part of the condition (not
   standalone): =i++= checks =i < 5= first and then increments, which is
   why the =5= in the first loop is printed, while =++i= increments first,
   and checks then.
   #+end_quote

*** ~for~ loops with multiple variables (assignment)

A ~for~ loop can go over multiple variables (of the same type) at once:

#+begin_src C

: i = 1, j = 1
: i = 2, j = 2
: i = 3, j = 3
: i = 4, j = 4

*** Nested ~for~ loops (bonus assignment)

A ~for~ loop can be part of another ~for~ loop:

#+begin_src C
  for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) { // enter first loop controlled by i
    for (int j = 0; j < 5; j++) { // enter second loop controlled by j
      printf("i = %d, j = %d\n",i,j); // loop runs 5 * 5 = 25 times
    }
   }

       a[i] = i;
       printf("%d ", a[i]);
      }
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : 0 1 2 3 4 5

   #+begin_quote
   The loop goes *out of bounds*: ~i <= 5~ means the loop accesses ~a[5]~,
   which is *outside* the valid range (~a[0]~ to ~a[4]~). This causes
   *undefined behavior* (go to 6: "stack smashing detected")
   #+end_quote

2. What's wrong with this code?
   #+begin_src C
     int a[3] = {1, 2, 3, 4}; // initializing an array
     printf("%d\n", a[3]);
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : 974493184

   #+begin_quote
   The initializer has *too many elements*. You can only initialize ~a[0]~
   to ~a[2]~ because the array size is 3. Accessing ~a[3]~ is a memory
   violation.
   #+end_quote

3. What's wrong with this code?
   #+begin_src C
     int a[4];  // an array that has not been initialized
     printf("%d\n", a[4]); // printing 0 here means NOTHING
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : 0

   #+begin_quote
   This prints an *uninitialized value*. Since ~a[4]~ was never assigned,
   it may contain garbage. C does *not* zero-initialize local arrays
   automatically (some compilers do).
   #+end_quote

4. What's wrong with this code?

   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:

   #+begin_quote
   There's *no null terminator*. ~printf("%s", s)~ expects a string ending
   with ~'\0'~. Without it, the output may include random memory past
   the array.
   #+end_quote

5. What's wrong with this code?
   #+begin_src C
     int i = -4;  // negative integer
     int a[5] = {0};  // initialize the array a with 0
     printf("%d\n", a[i]); // negative indices are now allowed
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : 0

   #+begin_quote
   Using a *negative index* like ~a[-4]~ is *undefined behavior*. C arrays
   don’t check bounds, and negative indexing will access memory

** Review: Introduction to functions

1. What does it mean for a C function to be "doubly ~void~"? Example?
   #+begin_quote
   A function is "doubly void" if it has no return value (~void~) and no
   parameters (~void~ or empty parentheses).
   #+end_quote

   #+begin_example C
     void hello(void); // no return value, no arguments
   #+end_example

2. Why should you declare a function before ~main()~ in a C program?
   #+begin_quote
   Declaring a function (also called prototyping) before ~main()~ allows
   the compiler to recognize the function when it is called, even if
   the definition comes later in the file.
   #+end_quote

   #+begin_example C
     float average(float, float); // compiler is told:
     // expect a function that returns a `float` and needs 2 `float` arguments
   #+end_example

3. What is the argument of the function ~hi2(char name[])~?
   #+begin_quote
   The argument is a string (represented in C as a character array),
   which holds the name to be included in the greeting (sample pgm).
   #+end_quote

4. How many functions are declared/defined/called in the following code?
   #+begin_src C
     #include <stdio.h>
     #include <math.h>

     double cube(double x);

     int main(void) {
       double number = 3.0;
       double result = cube(number);

       printf("The cube of %g is %g\n", number, result);
       return 0;
     }

     double cube(double x) {
       return pow(x, 3); // library function
     }
   #+end_src

   #+begin_quote
   Four functions are used: ~cube()~ is declared and defined by the
   user, ~main()~ is defined as required, and ~printf()~ and ~pow()~ are
   library functions called inside the program.
   #+end_quote

5. Why does the prototype of the function ~average~ look like this:
   ~float average(float, float);~? What's the difference to the function
   *definition*?
   #+begin_quote
   This prototype tells the compiler that the function ~average~ will
   return a ~float~ value and will take two ~float~ arguments. It's a
   forward declaration that allows the function to be used before it's
   defined. Specifying the types ensures correct type checking during
   compilation.

   For the function definition, the semicolon has to be replaced by a
   function body enclosed in ={ }=, and the arguments need to have names.
   #+end_quote

   #+begin_src C
     float average(float, float); // function declaration aka prototype

     int main() {
       printf("%g",average(5.9, 8.1)); // function call with arguments
     }

     float average(float a, float b) { // function definition with parameters
       return (a+b)/2.;

** Review 1: Pointers (creation to initialization)

1. What is the purpose of RAM in a computer system?
   #+begin_quote
   RAM (Random Access Memory) is a type of fast, temporary storage
   that holds the data and instructions a computer is actively
   using. It allows the CPU to quickly read from and write to memory
   while running programs. Unlike long-term storage (like a hard
   drive), the contents of RAM are lost when the computer is turned
   off.
   #+end_quote

2. What does it mean when we say a pointer holds the “address” of a
   variable?
   #+begin_quote
   A pointer stores the *memory location* where a variable is stored,
   not the value itself. It's like holding an envelope with a street
   address on it — the pointer tells you where to find the data in
   memory.
   #+end_quote

3. How is memory access different in languages like Java or Python
   compared to C/C++?
   #+begin_quote
   Languages like Java and Python abstract away direct memory
   access. They use references to manage objects and rely on garbage
   collection. In contrast, C exposes memory addresses through
   pointers, giving the programmer low-level control — and
   responsibility — for memory management.
   #+end_quote

4. What does the ~%p~ format specifier print in a C ~printf~ statement?
   #+begin_quote
   The ~%p~ specifier prints a memory address — that is, a pointer’s
   value. It shows where in memory a variable is stored, which is
   useful for understanding how indirection works.
   #+end_quote

5. Why is pointer manipulation considered both powerful and dangerous
   in C?
   #+begin_quote
   Pointers allow precise control over memory — you can directly read,
   write, and allocate memory at runtime. However, incorrect use
   (e.g., dereferencing invalid addresses, memory leaks, or buffer
   overflows) can easily lead to crashes or unpredictable behavior,
   making them error-prone without careful handling.
   #+end_quote

6. What is a pointer in C, and how is it declared?
   #+begin_quote
   A pointer is a variable that stores the *memory address* of another
   variable. It is declared using the asterisk (`*`) symbol.
   #+end_quote

   #+begin_src C
     int x = 42; // x is an integer with the value 42
     int *p = &x; // p is a pointer to x with the address-of x
   #+end_src

7. What does the indirection (dereferencing) operator ~*~ do?
   #+begin_quote
   The ~*~ operator, when used with a pointer, accesses the *value at the
   memory address* stored in the pointer.  Example: ~*p~ gives us the
   value stored in ~x~, because ~p~ points to ~x~.
   #+end_quote

   #+begin_src C
     int x = 10; // variable x stores value 10
     int *p = &x; // pointer p  stores address-of x
     printf("%d\n", *p); // prints value of x as dereferenced pointer to &x
     printf("%d\n", x); // prints value of x as dereferenced pointer to &x
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : 10
   : 10

8. What happens if you assign a literal integer (like 1) to a pointer?
   #+begin_quote
   Assigning a literal like ~p = 1;~ to a pointer is unsafe. It tells
   the pointer to point to memory address ~1~, which is typically
   invalid and can cause a segmentation fault.  The compiler will warn
   about this. Always assign a pointer with a valid address, like ~p =
   &x;~.
   #+end_quote
   #+begin_example
   warning: assignment to ‘int *’ from ‘int’
   makes pointer from integer without a cast
   #+end_example

9. What does the ~sizeof~ operator tell us about arrays?
   #+begin_quote
   ~sizeof(a)~ returns the total number of bytes used by the array ~a~,
   while ~sizeof(a[0])~ gives the size of a single element. This
   technique is commonly used to determine the length of statically
   allocated arrays.
   #+end_quote

   #+begin_src C
     int a[100];
     int size = sizeof(a) / sizeof(a[0]); // gives 100
     printf("%d\n", size);
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : 100

10. Why must you use ~&i~ in a call to ~scanf("%d", &i);~?
    #+begin_quote
    The ~scanf~ function needs the *address* of the variable to store the
    input in the correct memory location. ~&i~ passes that address.
    Without the ~&~, ~scanf~ would receive just a value and wouldn’t be
    able to modify the original variable.
    #+end_quote

** Review: Pointers (pass by value or reference)

1. What's wrong with this code fragment? How would you fix
   it?
   #+begin_src C
     int *p = &i;
     int i = 42;
   #+end_src
   #+begin_quote
   Variable =i= is used before it is declared. The pointer =p= tries to
   point to a variable that the compiler has not seen yet.

   Fix: Declare =i= before assigning a pointer =p= to its address.
   #+end_quote
   #+begin_src C
     int i = 42;
     int *p = &i;
     printf("i = %d, p = %p\n",i,p);
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : i = 42, p = 0x7ffc3a83466c

2. What's wrong with this code fragment? How would you fix
   it?
   #+begin_src C
     int *p;
     p = 2;
     (*p) = 5;
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:

   #+begin_quote
   =p = 2;= sets the pointer =p= to address =2= which is most likely invalid
   memory. Dereferencing =p= in =*p = 5;= causes a segmentation fault -
   there is no syntax error here.

   Fix: Declare a variable =i= and assign =p= to its address (=p = &i=)
   before attempting to change its value with =*p = 5=.
   #+end_quote
   #+begin_src C
     int i, *p = &i;
     (*p) = 2;
     printf("i = *p = %d\n",*p);
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : i = *p = 2

3. What's wrong with this code fragment? How would you fix it?
   #+begin_src C
     //int i = 100, *p = &i;
     int i;
     int *p;
     i = 100;
     p = &i;
     printf("i = *p = %d\n",*p);
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : i = *p = 100

   #+begin_quote
   Nothing is wrong with it! You can declare (=int *=) and initialize
   (=&i=) the pointer =p= on the same line! Same as: =int i=100; int *p=&i=
   #+end_quote

4. What's wrong with the following function? How would you fix it?
   #+begin_src C
     int plusTwo(int *x)
     {
       return (x + 2);
     }
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:

   #+begin_quote
   The error is *type mismatch*: =x= is a pointer to an =int=. =x + 2=
   performs *pointer arithmetic* (moves the pointer along in memory by 2
   integers (8 bytes).
   #+end_quote
   #+begin_src C
     int plusTwo(int *x)
     {
       return (*x + 2); // calling plusTwo(2) will return 2 + 2 = 4
     }
   #+end_src

5. What's wrong with the following function, how would you fix it?
   #+begin_src C
     int square(int *n) {
       return n * n;
     }
   #+end_src
   #+begin_quote
   =n= is a pointer to an =int(int *)=. =n * n= multiplies two pointers,
   which is invalid (since pointers are addresses and not numeric
   values).
   #+end_quote
   #+begin_src C
     int square(int *n) {
       return (*n) * (*n); // calling square(2) will return 2 * 2 = 4
     }
   #+end_src

** C structures

- The C ~struct~ is a public *class* of objects.
- It's a precursor of C++ classes.
- This is the beginning of *object-oriented* programming (OOP).
- OOP is the standard for building large-scale applications.

- The gradebook is complete from my perspective - please check.
- The purpose of this week is "C++ without (much) C".
- It will be a preparation for CSC 240 (Data structures with C++).
- We'll also discuss what you could do in the summer to prepare.

** Review: C ~struct~

1. What is a ~struct~ in C and why would you use it?
   #+begin_quote
   A ~struct~ is a *container* - it groups related variables (e.g.,
   coordinates, player stats) into a single data type to improve code
   organization and readability.
   #+end_quote

2. How would you declare a ~struct Date~ with calendar information?
   #+begin_src C :results none
     struct Date {
       int day;
       int month;
       int year;
     };
   #+end_src

3. How do you declare and initialize a ~struct Point~ with ~x = 3~ and ~y = 4~?
   #+begin_example C
     struct Point pt = {3, 4};
   #+end_example

4. How would you store and initialize 1000 ~struct Point~ values
   efficiently to the value 1?
   #+begin_quote
   Use an array and loop to initialize each ~points[i]~.
   #+end_quote
   #+begin_example C
     struct Point points[1000]; // Define 1000 Points
     for (int i=0;i<1000;i++) { points[i].x=1; points[i].y=1; }
   #+end_example

5. Why is it better to pass a pointer to a ~struct~ rather than the
   ~struct~ itself to a function?
   #+begin_quote
   Passing a pointer avoids copying the entire ~struct~, which saves
   memory and improves performance for large data sets.
   #+end_quote

6. What is the difference between ~.~ and ~->~ when accessing ~struct~
   members?
   #+begin_quote
   ~.~ is used for struct variables; ~->~ is used when accessing members
   via a pointer to a struct.
   #+end_quote
   #+begin_src C
     struct Person { int age; char sex; int height; }; // Any person
     struct Person Jack = { 23, 'm', 180 }; // A specific person - Jack

     printf("Jack is a %d old %cale of %d cm height.\n",
            Jack.age, Jack.sex, Jack.height); // Access values with .

     struct Person *aboutJack = &Jack; // points at Jack
     printf("Jack is a %d old %cale of %d cm height.\n",
            aboutJack->age, aboutJack->sex, aboutJack->height); // Access
                                                           // addresses
                                                           // with ->
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : Jack is a 23 old male of 180 cm height.
   : Jack is a 23 old male of 180 cm height.

** C to C++ Transition

- [ ] Transform C ~struct~ into C++ ~class~
- [ ] Understand that data can be ~private~ or ~public~
- [ ] Access ~private~ data with =getHealth=
- [ ] Create a =Player= class with =takeDamage= and =heal=
- [ ] Define ~class~ constructors and destructors
- [ ] Apply the ~this~ pointer inside ~class~ methods
- [ ] Create ~static~ members to track state across instances
- [ ] Understand the object lifecycle

** Review Questions: From struct in C to class in C++

1. What's an object?
   #+begin_quote
   In OOP, an "object" is anything that has attributes or features,
   and methods or abilities. For example, a ~Car~ object has the
   features ~color~, ~speed~, and ~fuel_level~, and the abilities to
   ~accelerate~, ~brake~, and ~refuel~.
   #+end_quote

2. What's OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)?
   #+begin_quote
   OOP is programming with objects and their ~private~ and ~public~
   abilities. Alternatively, you can also imagine that everything is
   an object, and that objects send each other messages.
   #+end_quote

3. What's the big deal with OOP?
   #+begin_quote
   It makes code easier to read, easier to maintain, and it makes code
   safer because you can now protect data from illegal access. In one
   word, it helps us to *scale* code in a real-world production setting.
   #+end_quote

4. How would a ~Car~ object, for example my car, a ~kia~ be created?
   #+begin_quote
   This is a two-step process:
   1) Declare a ~class~ for any ~Car~ (outside of ~main~).
   2) Declare an object ~kia~ that belongs to the ~Car~ class.
   3) ~kia~ now inherits all properties of the ~Car~ class.
   #+end_quote

   #+begin_example C++
   class Car { // all cars
    // features
    string color;
    float speed;
    float fuel_level;
    // abilities
    void accelerate(float amount) { // increase speed
       speed += amount;
       }
    void brake() { // stop the car
       speed = 0;
       }
    void refuel(float amount) { //
       fuel_level += amount;
       }
    };

    Car kia; // my Kia is a Car called `kia`
   #+end_example

5. What's wrong with this C++ object declaration?
   #+begin_src C++
     class Player John;
   #+end_src

   #+begin_quote
   You should not use the ~class~ keyword when creating an object —
   write =Player John;= instead.
   #+end_quote

6. Why does this code fail to compile if =Player::health= is ~private~?
   How to fix it?
   #+begin_src C++
     Player Jane; // this Player has `health`
     Jane.health = -1000;
   #+end_src

   #+begin_quote
   =health= is ~private~ and cannot be accessed directly from outside the
   class without providing a ~public~ method that lets you access it.

   Either provide a ~public~ method like =getHealth()=, or make =health=
   itself ~public~.
   #+end_quote

7. Why does this attempt to print the health value not work? How to
   fix it?
   #+begin_src C++
     Player John; // Player has a `getHealth()` method
     cout << getHealth() << endl;
   #+end_src

   #+begin_quote
   Because the computer does not know what or where =getHealth()= is. It
   needs to be told which ~class~ to use. The proper call is:
   =cout << John.getHealth() << endl;=
   #+end_quote

8. What's the problem with this =takeDamage= method?
   #+begin_src C++
     void takeDamage(int amount) {
       health -= amount;
     }
   #+end_src

   #+begin_quote
   It doesn’t check for negative values, which could increase =health=.
   #+end_quote

9. What's missing if we want the player to recover =health= after battle?
   #+begin_src C++
     Player John;
     John.takeDamage(50);
     // Now what?
   #+end_src

   #+begin_quote
   Add a =heal(int amount)= method to increase the player's health:
   =John.heal(80)=.
   #+end_quote

10. What if we wanted to cap the =health= of a =Player= at a certain value?
    #+begin_quote
    We'd have to add a condition using an ~if~ statement in our code.
    #+end_quote

Open [[https://onecompiler.com/cpp/43h75x8mz][OneCompiler.com/cpp]] to code along. 

1) *Will this code work? What does it do?*

   #+begin_src C++ :main yes :includes <iostream> :namespaces std
     // class definition
     class Car {
     };
     // main pg
     Car volkswagen;
   #+end_src

   #+begin_quote
   Yes, it works. A default =Car= named =volkswagen= is created.
   #+end_quote

2) *How could we add features, e.g. the =year= of the model, say 2022,
   and the =mileage=, say 25000 miles, to the default =Car=?*

   #+begin_src C++ :main yes :includes <iostream> :namespaces std
     class Car {
       const int year = 2022; // model year cannot change
       int mileage = 25000; // mileage will change
     };
     // main pgm
     Car volkswagen; // create a volkswagen Car
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:

3) *How can we print the =year= and the =mileage= of the =volkswagen= =Car=?*

   #+begin_src C++ :main yes :includes <iostream> :namespaces std :results output
     class Car {
       int year = 2022;
       int mileage = 25000;
     public:
       void printCar() {
         cout << "Car built in: " << year << endl
              << "Mileage: "      << mileage << " miles";
       }
     };

     // main pgm
     Car volkswagen;
     volkswagen.printCar();
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : Car built in: 2022
   : Mileage: 25000 miles

4) *How can we construct a =Car= with a different =year= and =mileage=, for
   example a =mercedes= built in =2019= with a =mileage= of =45000=?*

   #+begin_src C++ :main yes :includes <iostream> :namespaces std :results output
     class Car {
       const int year; // does not change
       int mileage;
     public:
       // Constructor
       Car(int y, int m) : year(y), mileage(m) {
         cout << "Car built in: " << year << endl
              << "Mileage: "      << mileage << " miles";
       }
     };

     // main pgm
     Car mercedes(2019,45000);
   #+end_src

   *You can also re-use the variable names with the ~this~ pointer:*

   #+begin_src C++ :main yes :includes <iostream> :namespaces std :results output
     class Car {
       const int year; // does not change
       int mileage;
     public:

         cout << "Car built in: " << this->year << endl
              << "Mileage: "      << this->mileage << " miles";
       }
     };

     // main pgm
     Car mercedes(2019,45000);
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : Car built in: 2019
   : Mileage: 45000 miles

5) *How can we destroy the =Car= that we created?*
   #+begin_src C++ :main yes :includes <iostream> :namespaces std :results output
     class Car {
       const int year; // does not change
       int mileage;
     public:
       // Constructor
       Car(int year, int mileage) : year(year), mileage(mileage) {
         cout << "Car built in: " << this->year << endl
              << "Mileage: "      << this->mileage << " miles" << endl;
       }
       // Destructor
       ~Car() { cout << "Car destroyed." << endl; }
     };

     // main pgm
     Car mercedes(2019,45000);
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : Car built in: 2019
   : Mileage: 45000 miles
   : Car destroyed.

6) *Now create a second car, a =jaguar= from =1985= with =220,000= miles.*
   #+begin_src C++ :main yes :includes <iostream> :namespaces std :results output
     class Car {
       const int year; // does not change
       int mileage;
     public:
       // Constructor
       Car(int year, int mileage) : year(year), mileage(mileage) {
         cout << "Car built in: " << this->year << endl
              << "Mileage: "      << this->mileage << " miles" << endl;
       }
       // Destructor
       ~Car() { cout << "Car destroyed." << endl; }

because =i= is never changed and the condition =i<10= is always =TRUE=. You
need to increment =i= with =i++=.
