* How to work with AI - three examples

- To compile this glossary, I copied the transcript of the video into
  a ChatGPT conversation and asked for the glossary using this prompt:

  #+begin_example
  You are given the transcript of a short introductory video about the
  C programming language.

  Task:
  1. Extract glossary terms that are explicitly mentioned in the transcript.
  2. Create a glossary table with three columns: a running number, the term,
     and a short explanation.
  3. Explanations should be concise (one short sentence), suitable for beginners.
  4. Do not introduce concepts that are not directly stated in the transcript.
  5. Use Org-mode table formatting.
  6. Keep wording simple and faithful to the video.

  Output only the glossary table in a code verbatim window, nothing else.
  #+end_example

- To produce this poster and the slides that you can find in GitHub, I
  used the Syllabus and my first overview lecture with NotebookLM:
  #+attr_html: :width 400px :float nil:
  [[../img/1_overview_poster.png]]
 
- I also used NotebookLM to produce a set of flashcards from the
  lecture. This would be a good way to study difficult material - less
  computer science (little to memorize) but history for example.

- We will explore this more as soon as we get into coding.
