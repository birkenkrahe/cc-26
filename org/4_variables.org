* Variables

- Just like your decision-making depends on what you know (and
  remember), the computer's ability to compute depends on memory.

- When you give it a job, the computer needs to carefully plan its
  memory - very much like when you schedule your day, except not in
  units of time but in bits.

- One strength of C is that you have all the power of scheduling
  the computer's memory. One weakness is that you must do this.

- The price: To decide how much memory to reserve for its operations,
  you need to assign a /data type/ to every number or string that you
  need.

- The prize: Once you've done this (picked types), you can change the
  /value/ in the reserved memory cells, which are also called /variables/.

- Examples of data type declarations:
  #+begin_src C :results none
    int height;   // an integer variable called `height`
    float profit;  // a floating-point variable called `profit`
    char name;  // a character variable called `name`
  #+end_src

- After this point, the compiler will have reserved enough memory for
  these three variables. If you don't reserve memory, you cannot use
  the variable.

- To test that, write just =height;= in the =main= program and run
  it. This will not work unless =height= was declared first.

  Wrong:
  #+begin_src C :results none
    height;  // cannot use `height` without declaring it first
  #+end_src

  Right:
  #+begin_src C :results none
    int height; // declare integer variable `height`
    height;  // cannot use `height` without declaring it first
  #+end_src

- If you use an editor, you can see the syntax highlighting, which is
  chosen to indicate keywords and variable names (not always useful).

- You can also declare several variables of the same type on one line:
  #+begin_src C :results none
    int height, width;
  #+end_src

* Why is the computer so serious about memory?

- The computer has dementia built into its very fabric. This is also
  called von-Neumann architecture - the way all computers are built:

  #+begin_example
    SMALL     <     MEDIUM      <     LARGE       [Storage]
  +--------+      +----------+      +--------+
  |  CPU   | ---- | Memory   | ---- |  Disk  |
  +--------+      |  (RAM)   |      | (NVM)  |
                  +----------+      +--------+
   VERY FAST  >      FAST       >      SLOW       [Speed]
  #+end_example

- When you write a program, it is stored on the disk (NVM) and has to
  be loaded into memory (RAM) so that the brain (CPU) can get to
  it. And every time the computer is switched off, the memory is
  erased completely, and only the disk (Non-Volatile Memory) remains,
  so everything has to be written to it that you wish to keep.

- The faster the device (CPU > RAM > NVM) the more expensive the
  memory. The memory determines the performance of your computations
  more than anything - even though most programming languages never
  make you think about it!

- The less information the computer has about the data you intend to
  feed to it to work with, the lower its performance. This makes no
  difference if you play Candy Crush, but if you play an online
  multiplayer game, or if your computer is on board of an autonomous
  vehicle, or on a space ship, or on an airplane...it matters much.

* PRACTICE Variable types and declarations

Write a complete program that declares two floating-point variables,
=fahrenheit= and =celsius=, and print their values.

Example output:
#+begin_example
0.000000 Fahrenheit = 0.000000 Celsius
#+end_example

Solution:
#+begin_src C :main no
  #include <stdio.h>

  int main(void)
  {
    float fahrenheit, celsius;
    printf("%f Fahrenheit = %f Celsius\n", fahrenheit, celsius);
    return 0;
  }
#+end_src

* Variable assignment: integers

- A variable gets its value through *assignment* with the ~=~ /operator/.

- In the code block below, the variable =height= gets the value =8= with
  the assignment operator ===. The number =8= is also called a *"literal"*
  because it cannot change.
  #+begin_example C
    height = 8;
  #+end_example

- If you would try to run the code above, you would get an error. Can
  you see why?
  #+begin_quote
  *Answer:* An assignment counts as use of a variable. The type of a
  variable must be declared before you can use it.
  #+end_quote
  
- The example below would throw another error. What's wrong now?
  #+begin_example C
    height = 8;
    int height;
  #+end_example
  #+begin_quote
  *Answer:* The declaration of variable must precede its first use.
  #+end_quote

- Phew! The next block finally works, that is, it compiles and
  runs. But what does the code actually do?
  #+begin_src C :results silent
    int height;
    height = 8;
  #+end_src
  #+begin_quote
  *Answer:* =int height;= reserves memory for an integer variable called
  =height=, and =height = 8;= puts the numeric integer value =8= into the
  corresponding memory cell. From now on, whenever you use =height=, the
  computer will substitute the value =8= for it.
  #+end_quote

* PRACTICE Changing literals

1) Try to change the value of the literal (constant) =8= by assigning
   another integer to it, e.g. =8 = 18=. What's the result?

2) What is the error message when you compile this program:
   #+begin_src C :results none
     8 = 18;
   #+end_src

   Error message:
   #+begin_example
   literal.c: In function ‘main’:
   literal.c:3:8: error: lvalue required as left operand of assignment
       3 |      8 = 18;
         |        ^
   #+end_example

3) Can you understand it? If you don't know what /lvalue/ means, google it.
   #+begin_quote
   *Explanation:* `lvalue` stands for `left value` and stands for an
   object that you can assign a value to. But in the statement, =8= is
   not a variable but a literal or constant. Its memory is *persistent*,
   and not *variable*.
   #+end_quote

4) How then can you change a variable called =foo= from the value =8= to
   =18=? Answer with *two lines* of code.
   #+begin_src C
     int foo = 8; // declare `foo` and define its value
     foo = 18;  // change value of `foo`
   #+end_src

5) Test the code by inserting suitable print statements. Output:
   #+begin_example
   foo = 8
   foo = 18
   #+end_example

   #+begin_src C :results output
     int foo = 8; // declare `foo` and define its value
     printf("foo = %i\n",foo);
     foo = 18;  // change value of `foo`
     printf("foo = %i\n",foo);
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : foo = 8
   : foo = 18

* Variable assignment: floating-point numbers

- A /floating-point literal/ assigned to a ~float~ variable contains a
  decimal point and the letter ~f~ to indicate its "floatiness":
  #+begin_src C :results silent
    float profit;
    profit = 2150.48f;  // 'f' specifies the float format
  #+end_src

- Assigning a ~float~ to an ~int~ and vice versa is possible (but not
  safe as we will see) - the compiler will not warn you:
  #+begin_src C :results silent
    /* ASSIGNING A floating point value TO AN integer variable*/
    int iProfit = 2150.48;  // Don't do this!

    /* ASSIGNING AN integer TO AN floating point variable */
    float profit = 2150;  // Don't do this!
  #+end_src

- Variables with values can be used to compute other values:
  #+begin_src C :results silent
    // variable declarations
    int height, length, width, volume;

    // variable assignments
    height = 8;
    length = 12;
    width = 10;

    // variable evaluation
    volume = height * length * width;
  #+end_src

- How many tasks does this last little program perform?
  #+begin_quote
  Answer:
  1. Declare four variables (4)
  2. Assign three variables (7)
  3. Compute one variable (8)

  8 tasks: The program messes 8 times with computer memory.
  #+end_quote

* PRACTICE Declare, Assign, Compute and Print

- You can also initiate and declare several variables at once:
  1) Declare *and* assign = define =height= 8, =length= 12, =width= 10.
  2) Compute the volume *inside* the =printf= function call.
  3) How many tasks does this program perform?

  Solution:
  #+begin_src C
    int height = 8, length = 12, width = 10; // 6
    printf("Volume: %i", height * length * width); // + 1
  #+end_src

* PRACTICE In-Class Practice 4: Variable Manipulation and Formatted Output
** Objective

Practice variable declaration, assignment, arithmetic operations, and
formatted output in C.

** Instructions

1. Write a C program =
2. Declare an integer variable named =num= and initialize it to 10.
3. Declare an integer variable named =doubleNum= that holds twice the
   value of =num=.
4. Declare a floating-point variable named =half= that holds half of
   the value of =num=.
5. Print the following three lines using a single =printf= statementwith
   the correct format specifiers:
   - "The number is: 10"
   - "Double the number is: 20"
   - "Half the number is: 5.000000"
6. Ensure your program includes the proper header files and returns 0
   from the =main= function.

** Sample Output
#+begin_example
The number is: 10
Double the number is: 20
Half the number is: 5.000000
#+end_example

** Program template:
#+begin_src C :main no :results output
  #include <stdio.h>

  /* main program */
  int main(void)
  {
    // declare and define variables

    // print results

    return 0;
  }
#+end_src

* Summary

This section introduces key programming concepts in C, starting with
variables and memory management. It explains how variables function
like reserved memory spaces and the necessity of defining their types
before use. Assigning values with the === operator is covered, along
with best practices for declaring multiple variables.

A deeper dive into the importance of memory highlights how computing
performance is affected by variable storage. The von Neumann
architecture is briefly discussed, emphasizing the need for memory
efficiency.

Exercises reinforce variable declarations, assignments, and modifying
literals, encouraging hands-on practice. The section concludes with an
introduction to floating-point numbers, format specifiers in =printf=,
and arithmetic operations using variables.
