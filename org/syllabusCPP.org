* Objectives

This course introduces you to programming using C. We cover C++ as an
extension. C is a system programming language of pure power: it
enables you to converse with the computer at a level unknown to users
other high level languages many of which come from C. You also learn
about: compilers, working on the command line, text editors Emacs,
using C for Internet of Things (IoT) devices, cybersecurity, using
pseudocode and process modeling. You get a foundation in critical
thinking in concert with two of the three currently most popular
languages (cp. TIOBE, 2023): the next three languages are Java, C# and
JavaScript, which you can learn in a fortnight after this
course). You’ll learn some great tools: we use the “hacker’s editor”
Emacs, the world’s foremost software engineering platform, GitHub, and
BPMN for process modeling and pseudo code generation. For those
interested in computer and data science, this course is a bridge to
CSC 240 Data structures in C++ and CSC 265 Algorithms (with Python).

* Student Learning Outcomes

Students who complete CSC 100.01 "Introduction to programming in C++",
will be able to:

- Master basic sequential programming skills (conditional
  statements, loops, functions, input/output, use of data types)
- Explain the basic components of a procedural programming language
- Apply the basics of programming to solve a variety of quantitative
  problems
- Master computing infrastructure (compiler, editor, shell)
- Research and present a project as a team
- Know how to effectively present assignment results
- Be ready for "Data stuctures with C++" (CSC 240)
- Get ready for "Algorithms" (CSC 265)
- Improve their data literacy skills

* Course requirements / prerequisites

- MTH 110 College algebra or permission from the instructor
- No prior programming or computing knowledge required
- Experience with computers is useful but not critical
- Curiosity is essential, and willingness to try new things!
- To get the most out of this course you must code, code, code!

* Grading system

You should be able to see your current grade at any time using the
Canvas gradebook for the course.

| WHEN       | DESCRIPTION             | IMPACT |
|------------+-------------------------+--------|
| Weekly     | Programming assignments |    40% |
| Weekly     | Multiple choice tests   |    25% |
| Week 14-16 | Final project           |    15% |
| TBD        | Final exam (optional)   |    20% |

Notes:
- *To pass:* 60% of all available points.
- *Tests:* weekly online quizzes based on the assigned reading and on
  classroom practice.
- *Final exam:* random selection of the known test questions. *Note:* You
  only have to write the final exam if you want to improve your grade
  at the end of the course. If the final exam result is below your
  final grade average up to this point, it will be ignored.
- There will be numerous (optional) *bonus assignments* to improve your
  midterm and final grades.

* Grading table

This table is used to convert completion rates into letter grades. for
the midterm results, letter grades still carry signs, while for the
term results, only straight letters are given (by rounding up). This
table is also used in Canvas to compute your grades. Transitions
between letter grades are rounded (e.g. 89.5% to 90%).

|------------------+------------------|
| Percentage       | LETTER GRADE*    |
|------------------+------------------|
| 100% to 89.5%    | A (very good)    |
|------------------+------------------|
| < 89.5% to 79.5% | B (good)         |
|------------------+------------------|
| < 79.5% to 69.5% | C (satisfactory) |
|------------------+------------------|
| < 69.5% to 59.5% | D (passed)       |
|------------------+------------------|
| < 59.5% to 0%    | F (FAILED)       |
