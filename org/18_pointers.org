- This script introduces C pointers in theory and practice.

- This section, including some sample code, is based on: chapter 11
  in King (2008), and chapter 7 in Davenport/Vine.

* Overview

- Remember the fundamental architectural problem of the "von Neumann"
  architecture of digital computers.

  - Imagine: CPU \equiv brain, Memory \equiv house, Harddisk \equiv moon

    1. CPU and the Brain: The CPU (Central Processing Unit) is like the
       brain because it is responsible for processing all instructions
       and making decisions. It performs the core computations and
       controls other parts of the computer based on the input it
       receives, similar to how the brain processes sensory information
       and dictates responses.
    2. RAM and a House: RAM (Random Access Memory) is akin to a house
       because it serves as the active, working area where tasks are
       carried out and information is temporarily held. Just as a house
       contains rooms where daily activities occur (e.g., sleeping,
       eating, working), RAM holds active applications and data for
       quick access by the CPU. The size of the RAM affects how much
       activity (or how many applications) can be handled at once, much
       like the size of a house determines how many activities can
       comfortably occur simultaneously.
    3. Hard Disk and the Moon: A hard disk is comparable to the Moon in
       that it serves as a distant but integral storage location. Just
       as the Moon orbits Earth and is a more remote body holding
       impacts of meteorites and historical footprints, a hard disk
       stores data that is not immediately needed for current processing
       tasks but is crucial for long-term storage. Its contents are not
       as quickly accessible as those in RAM, reflecting the Moon’s
       greater distance compared to our immediate environment.

- Computer memory is like a list of /locations/
  #+caption: Sample data stored in an imaginary memory stack
  #+attr_latex: :width 400px
  [[../img/memory.png]]

- Each chunk of memory has an /address/ to a location.

- /Pointers/ point to these addresses:

- The /address/ is not the house, it's a /reference/ to the house:

* Pointers in other languages

Most languages besides C/C++, like C#, Java, Python...do not offer
pointers (easily) - most of the direct memory management is
"abstracted" away (i.e. the memory is hidden and a simpler user
interface is offered).

#+begin_quote
1. *C#:* C# does support pointers, but their use is limited to unsafe
   code blocks. You must explicitly mark these areas with the =unsafe=
   keyword. This feature allows you to perform operations that
   involve direct memory access, similar to C or C++. However, using
   pointers is generally discouraged in favor of safer constructs
   provided by the language, such as objects and reference types.
2. *Java:* Java does not support pointers, at least not in the
   traditional sense as seen in C or C++. Instead, Java handles
   memory through references to objects, and these references are
   abstracted away from direct memory address manipulation. This
   abstraction is part of Java's design to ensure security and
   simplicity in memory management, reducing the likelihood of
   errors such as memory leaks or pointer arithmetic.
3. *Python*: Python also does not use pointers. It handles everything
   by object references. The language is designed to abstract away
   most direct memory management tasks from the developer,
   automatically handling object creation and destruction through a
   built-in garbage collector. Python’s approach simplifies the
   development process but at the cost of direct control over memory
   and performance optimizations that pointers can offer.
4. *R:* R does not support pointers in the traditional sense used in
   lower-level languages like C. Instead, R uses a system of
   pass-by-value semantics with copy-on-modify behavior, meaning that
   objects are generally copied when modified, though under the hood
   this is optimized using references to avoid unnecessary duplication.
   Memory management in R is handled automatically through garbage
   collection, and direct manipulation of memory addresses is not
   exposed to the user. While advanced users can interface with C
   code via the =.C= or =.Call= interfaces for performance or memory
   control, everyday R programming is intentionally abstracted from
   low-level memory details to promote safety and ease of use.

* What's the big deal?

- C and C++ offer pointer variables and operators naturally.

- This gives you a lot more control over the computer (because every
  operation, every process involves memory management).

- Examples:

  + *String manipulation*: Strings are arrays (working with text -
    e.g. when creating fast-performing chat bots or AI agents).

    #+begin_src C
      char *name = "Marcus"; // pointer to 'M' ('\0' is added at end)

      printf("Hello, %s\n", name); // the whole string = array
    #+end_src

    #+RESULTS:
    : Hello, Marcus

  + *Dynamic memory allocation* - the process of assigning memory
    during the execution time (when a program typically competes
    with thousands of other processes).

    #+begin_src C
      int *p = malloc(sizeof(int)); // allocate memory for 1 integer
      (*p) = 42;  // de-reference the pointer p
      printf("%d\n", *p); // print the value
      free(p); // de-allocate the memory
    #+end_src

    #+RESULTS:
    : 42

- About the =sizeof= operator: It returns the size of a memory cell (10
  elements of length 4 for an integer each):
  #+begin_src C
    int a[10];

    int size_a0 = sizeof(a[0]); // size of array element
    int size_a  = sizeof(a)/size_a0; // size of array

    printf("Size of array element = %d\n", size_a0);
    printf("Size of array         = %d\n", size_a);
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : Size of array element = 4
  : Size of array         = 10

- This is *mind control*: You can essentially decide what the computer
  should think with which part of its "brain" (great potential to mess
  up, too), e.g. when you mis-allocate resources.

* Indirection (concept)

- Imagine you have a /variable/ ~iResult~ that contains the /value/ ~75~.

- The variable is /located/ at a memory address, e.g. ~0061FEC8~. To find
  this out, you need to print its address, =&iResult=, with ~%p~.

  #+begin_src C
    int iResult = 75.;
    printf("%d is referenced by %p\n", iResult, &iResult);
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : 75 is referenced by 0x7ffedb3a66a4

- Repeated executions of this code creates different addresses. A
  pointer is a variable that holds an address.

- Imagine you have a /pointer variable/ ~myPointer~ that contains the
  address of the variable ~iResult~:
  #+begin_src C
    int iResult = 75;
    printf("%d <- %p\n", iResult, &iResult);

    int *myPointer = &iResult;
    printf("%p -> %d\n",myPointer, iResult);
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : 75 <- 0x7ffcc88ea81c
  : 0x7ffcc88ea81c -> 75

- This means that ~myPointer~ /indirectly/ points to the value ~75~.

- You already worked with addresses: An /array name/ ~a~ is a pointer to
  the start of the array, the address of ~a[0]~:

  #+begin_src C
    int a[3] = {100,200,300}; // define an array
    printf("a = %d", *a);  // printing `a` means printing `*a`
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : a = 100

- The conversion specifier ~%p~ lets us access the addresses that
  correspond to elements of the array ~a~, and even the address for the
  whole array.

- We declare an array ~a[2]~ and then we print its addresses:
  #+name: ptrprint
  #+begin_src C
    int a[2] = {100,1000}; // define a 1-dim array of 2 elements
    printf("a[0] = %p\na[1] = %p\n&a   = %p\n", &a[0], &a[1], &a);
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS: ptrprint
  : a[0] = 0x7ffe2c131d20
  : a[1] = 0x7ffe2c131d24
  : &a   = 0x7ffe2c131d20

- You can see that the address for ~a~ points to ~a[0].~

- You already worked with pointers: arguments in the call of ~scanf~
  are /pointers/: without the ~&~, the function would be supplied with
  the /value/ of ~i~, not the /address/. But ~scanf~'s job is to assign a
  memory location (an address) to the input variable.
  #+begin_example C
  int i; // reserve memory for an integer called `i`
  scanf("%d", &i); // put the keyboard input into that memory
  #+end_example

- The relationship between variable value and memory address is called
  *indirection*: A /pointer/ provides /indirect/ access to the value via the
  address where the value is stored.

* Indirection (code)

- There are two /unary/ pointer operators:
  - the /address/ (or referencing) operator ~&~
  - the /indirection/ (or dereferencing) operator ~*~

- The unary /address/ operator ~&~ returns a computer memory address,
  e.g. ~&i = 0x7ffc7600b79c~ - it /references/ the memory location.

- What if ~i~ has not been initialized yet? Will the address change?
  Print the reference to ~i~ before initializing it, and after.
  #+begin_src C
    int i;  // reserve memory for an integer i
    printf("%p\n",&i); // print the memory address
    i = 100;  // assign a value to i
    printf("%p\n",&i); // print the memory address
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : 0x7ffd9b388cc4
  : 0x7ffd9b388cc4

- The unary /indirection/ operator ~*~ returns a value, e.g. ~*p = 75~ if ~p~
  points at a variable that contains the value ~75~.

- Let's do it all in one code block (*Open your C editor now*):
  1) declare an integer variable ~i~
  2) assign the value ~1~ to ~i~
  3) declare an integer pointer ~*p~
  4) assign the address of ~i~ to ~p~
  5) print ~i~ and ~&i~ (~"is located at address"~)
  6) print ~p~ and ~*p~ (~"points to value"~)

  #+begin_src C
    // variables
    int i; // declare integer variable
    i = 1; // assign value to variable

    // pointers
    int *p; // declare integer pointer
    p = &i; // assign address to pointer

    // print variable value
    // PRINT "i is located at address &i"
    printf("%d is located at address %p\n",i,&i);

    // print pointer memory address
    // PRINT "p points to the value i"
    printf("%p points to value %d\n",p,i);
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : 1 is located at address 0x7ffd25faa58c
  : 0x7ffd25faa58c points to value 1

- What if you assign a number ~1~ to ~p~ instead of an address?
  #+begin_src C
    int *p; // declare integer pointer
    p = 1; // warning: missing 'cast' (C knows p is an address)

    // print pointer value
    printf("%p\n",p); // '0x1' is a reserved memory address
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : 0x1

- Compiler message (~-Wint-conversion~ is a compiler flag):
  #+begin_example
   warning: assignment to ‘int *’ from ‘int’ makes pointer from integer
            without a cast [-Wint-conversion]
   15 | p = 1; // warning: missing 'cast'
      |   ^
  #+end_example

- Here is more documentation on compiler warnings. You can add them to
  your code block with the header argument ~:flags~, e.g. ~:flags -Wall~

- The figure illustrates these concepts. Can you describe what
  goes on from line to line?
  #+attr_html: :width 500px
  #+caption: Graphical illustration of the indirection operator (Source: King)
  [[../img/16_indirection.png]]

  #+begin_quote Answer
  1) The pointer ~p~ points to the address ~&i~ of the variable ~i~.
  2) ~i~ is initialized with the value ~1~. ~p~ still points at it.
  3) To change the value of ~i~ indirectly using the pointer ~p~, we
     assign ~*p = 2~. The indirection operator ~*~ designates a pointer.
  4) To check that ~i~ indeed has been changed, we print it.
  5) ~*p~ also prints the value of ~i~.

* Practice: Indirection operator

- Code the example that you just saw.

- The value for the *NULL* pointer is just that: =NULL=.

- Use the starter code: [[https://onecompiler.com/c/43fg9nvyj][onecompiler.com/c/43fg9nvyj]]

- Sample output:
  #+begin_example
  Variable: 1 - Pointer: 1
  Variable: 2 - Pointer: 2
  #+end_example

- Solution:
  #+begin_src C
    /* Change value of integer variable using pointer to variable
       Input: initialized integer variable, initialied NULL pointer
       Output: print original value of variable and pointer to variable
       before and after the change of value */

    // include standard input/output library header file
    #include <stdio.h>

    int main()
    {
      // declare integer variable
      int i;
      // declare and initialize NULL pointer
      int *p = NULL;
      // store address-to variable in pointer
      p = &i;
      // assign 1 to variable
      i = 1;
      // print values of variable and of pointer to variable
      printf("Variable: %d - Pointer: %d\n",i,*p);
      // change value of variable to 2 using pointer to variable
      ,*p = 2;
      // print values of variable and of pointer to variable
      printf("Variable: %d - Pointer: %d\n",i,*p);
      return 0;
    }
  #+end_src

* Practice: Reassigning Pointers and Changing Values

- The following program starts with two variables a, b pointed at by
  two pointers p and q. We then manipulate the variable values by
  reassigning the pointers.

- Starter Pseudocode: [[https://onecompiler.com/c/43fhagatk][onecompiler.com/c/43fhagatk]]
  #+begin_src C
    /* pointers.c: Manipulate variables using pointers */
    /* Author: Marcus Birkenkrahe (pledged) GPLv3 */
    /* Date: 04/20/2025 */

    // declare two integer variables a and b

    // declare two integer pointers p and q

    // assign values: 5 to a and 10 to b

    // point p to a, point q to b

    // print values pointed to by p and q

    // assign value pointed to by p to value pointed to by q

    // print the values of a and b directly

    // reassign p to point to b

    // change value of b to 20 using the pointer p

    // print a and b directly

    // print values pointed to by p and q

  #+end_src

- Sample output:
  #+begin_example
  Values a = 5, b = 10
  Values a = 5, b = 5
  Values a = 5, b = 20
  Values a = 20, b = 20
  #+end_example

- Solution:
  #+begin_src C
    // declare two integer variables a and b
    int a, b;
    // declare two integer pointers p and q
    int *p, *q;
    // assign values: 5 to a and 10 to b
    a = 5, b = 10;
    // point p to a, point q to b
    p = &a, q = &b;
    // print values pointed to by p and q
    printf("p points to %d, q points to %d\n", *p, *q);
    // assign value pointed to by p to value pointed to by q
    (*q) = (*p);
    // print the values of a and b directly
    printf("Values a = %d, b = %d\n", a, b);
    // reassign p to point to b
    p = &b;
    // change value of b to 20 using the pointer p
    (*p) = 20;
    // print a and b directly
    printf("Values a = %d, b = %d\n", a, b);
    // print value pointed to by p and q
    printf("Values a = %d, b = %d\n", *p, *q);
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : p points to 5, q points to 10
  : Values a = 5, b = 5
  : Values a = 5, b = 20
  : Values a = 20, b = 20

- Analysis:

  | CODE           | EXPLANATION                         |
  |----------------+-------------------------------------|
  | =a = =5, b = =10=  | Assign values to a, b directly      |
  | =p = &a, q = =&b= | Pointers point a address-of a, b    |
  | =*p, *q=         | Dereferenced pointers p,q print a,b |
  | =*q == *p=        | Move value *p = a into *q = b:      |
  |                | Now a, b have the same values       |
  |                | but p still points at a, q at b     |
  | =p == &b=         | Redirect p to address-of b          |
  |                | Now both q and p point at b         |
  | =*p == 20=        | Change value of b to 20             |
  |                | Both dereference pointers print b   |
  |                | The value of a is not changed.      |

* ~*~ and ~&~ are inverse to one another

- Address and indirection operator are /inverse/ to one another
  (i.e. they reverse each other's operation - applying both amounts
  to doing nothing).

- Applying indirection ~*~ to an address /dereferences/ it.

- Applying referencing ~&~ to a pointer extracts its address.

  #+name: inverseOps
  #+begin_src C
    // declaring and initializing
    int val = 75, *ptr = &val;

    // print variable and dereferenced pointer
    printf("value = %d => *&(value) = %d\n",
           val, *&val);

    // print pointer and address of pointer
    printf("pointer = %p => &*(ptr) = %p\n",
           ptr, &*ptr);
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS: inverseOps
  : value = 75 => *&(value) = 75
  : pointer = 0x7ffeae98ae4c => &*(ptr) = 0x7ffeae98ae4c

- Applying ~*~ to the pointer takes us back to the original variable
  (dereferences the pointer)
  #+begin_example C
    j = *&i  // same as j = i
  #+end_example

* Practice: Referencing and De-referencing

- Practice how ~*~ (indirection) and ~&~ (address-of) are inverse
  operations in C.

- Write a short C program that:
  1. Declares an integer variable and assigns it a value.
  2. Declares a pointer to that variable using ~&~.
  3. Uses ~*~ to get the original value from the pointer.
  4. Prints all of the following:
     + The value of the variable.
     + The value of ~*&variable~.
     + The value of ~*pointer~.
     + The value of ~&*pointer~.

- Starter code: [[https://onecompiler.com/c/43fhb4ft3][onecompiler.com/c/43fhb4ft3]]
  #+begin_src C
    // BEGIN
    // DECLARE integer variable x
    // SET x to some value

    // DECLARE pointer p to integer
    // SET p to address of x

    // PRINT value of x
    // PRINT value of *&x
    // PRINT value of *p
    // PRINT value of &*p
    // END
  #+end_src

- Sample output:
  #+begin_example
   x = 123
   *&x = 123
   *p = 123
   &*p = 0x7fffc147e19c
  #+end_example

- Solution:
  #+begin_src C
    #include <stdio.h>

    int main(void) { // BEGIN
      int x; // DECLARE integer variable x
      x = 123; // SET x to some value

      int *p;  // DECLARE pointer p to integer
      p = &x;  // SET p to address of x

      printf("x = %d\n", x); // PRINT value of x
      printf("*&x = %d\n", *&x); // PRINT value of *&x
      printf("*p = %d\n", *p); // PRINT value of *p
      printf("&*p = %p\n", (void *)&*p); // PRINT value of &*p

      return 0;
    }  // END
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : x = 123
  : *&x = 123
  : *p = 123
  : &*p = 0x7fffc147e19c

* Pointers must be initialized

- Non-initialized pointers lead to invalid data or expressions.

- Pointer variables should always be initialized with:
  + another variable's memory address (e.g. ~&i~), OR
  + with 0, OR
  + with the keyword ~NULL~.

- Here are some /valid/ pointer initializations - ~printf~ uses the
  conversion specifier ~%p~ for pointers.
  #+name: ptrInit
  #+begin_src C :tangle ./src/ptrinit.c
    double *ptr1;  // pointer declarations
    int *ptr2;
    int *ptr3;
    double x = 3.14; // initialize variable

    ptr1 = &x; // initialize with address
    ptr2 = 0;  // initialize with 0
    ptr3 = NULL; // initialize with NULL

    printf("%p %p %p\n", ptr1, ptr2, ptr3);
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS: ptrInit
  : 0x7ffc31e308e8 (nil) (nil)

- Let's print these last values: how do you have to change the ~printf~
  statement? (Add the flag ~-w~ to disable all warnings)
  #+begin_src C :flags -w
    double *ptr1;  // pointer declarations
    int *ptr2;
    int *ptr3;
    double x = 3.14; // initialize variable

    ptr1 = &x; // initialize with address
    ptr2 = 0;  // initialize with 0
    ptr3 = NULL; // initialize with NULL

    // different conversion specifiers
    printf("%.2f %d %d\n", *ptr1, ptr2, ptr3);
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : 3.14 0 0

- Here are a few non-valid initializations: we want to change the
  value of a variable using the pointer to its memory address.
  + can you tell why?
  + can you right the wrong?
  + print ~iPtr~, ~&i~ and ~i~
  #+begin_src C :results silent
    int i=5; // declare integer i
    int *iPtr; // declare pointer iPtr

    iPtr = &i; // initialize pointer
    iPtr = 7;  // change value of variable
  #+end_src

- Solution:
  #+begin_src C :results output
    int i;
    int *iPtr;

    iPtr = &i;   // pointer initialized with memory address
    ,*iPtr = 7;   // value of i indirectly changed

    printf("%p %p %d\n", iPtr, &i, i);
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : 0x7ffcdcbffb9c 0x7ffcdcbffb9c 7

  // declare double precision variable
  double var = 3.14159;
  // declare pointer to double precision variable
  double *ptr;

  // initialize pointer
  ptr = &var;      // ptr is assigned the address of var
  (*ptr) = 2.71828; // value of var is indirectly changed to the Euler number

  // print pointer, address and value of i
  printf("Deref'd ptr %g\nAddress-of var = %p\nValue of var = %g\n",
         ,*ptr, ptr, var);
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: Deref'd ptr 2.71828
: Address-of var = 0x7ffeee9bca28
: Value of var = 2.71828

* Pass by value and pass by reference

- Since we've established the difference between a value and a
  reference (or address), we can use it in functions.

- What happens here?
  #+begin_src C :main no :includes
    #include <stdio.h> // input/output
    // swap two integer arguments a->b, b->a
    void swap(int, int);

    /* main function */
    int main(void)
    {
      // declare and initialize two integer variables
      int x = 5, y = 10;
      // PRINT "Before swap: (x,y)"
      printf("Before swap: (%d,%d)\n", x, y);
      // swap x and y
      swap(x,y);
      // PRINT "After swap (in `main`): (x,y)"
      printf("After swap (in 'main'): (%d,%d)\n", x, y);

      return 0;
    }
    /* function definition */
    void swap(int a, int b) {
      int temp; // store value of a temp-orarily
      temp = a;
      a = b;
      b = temp;
      // PRINT "After swap (swap): (a,b)"
      printf("After swap (in 'swap'): (%d,%d)\n", a, b);
    }
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : Before swap: (5,10)
  : After swap (in 'swap'): (10,5)
  : After swap (in 'main'): (5,10)

- Explanation:
  #+begin_quote
  We're thwarted by the main advantage of functions: That their values
  are encapsulated and that their memory is returned when the function
  is done. The arguments x,y are said to be *passed by value*.
  #+end_quote

- How can we swap the numbers so that they remain swapped?
  #+begin_quote
  Instead of passing the values, we can pass the addresses of the
  memory cells where x and y reside - then the swap will be
  permanent. This is called *pass by reference*.

* Challenge: Incrementing an integer by value/reference

- The difference between modfiying a variable inside a function by:
  1) Pass by value (no lasting effect)
  2) Pass by reference (permanent effect using pointers)

- Write two functions:
  1. =void increment_val(int)= to increment an ~int~ passed by value
  2. =void increment_ref(int*)= to increment an ~int~ passed by reference

* Passing arrays and pointers to functions

- When you pass an array to a function, it "decays" into a pointer to
  its first element.

- This means that you can either
  1) pass an array (looks like an array =a[]=), or
  2) pass a pointer (which is how C does it internally).


- Example:
  1) =addArr= adds the first two elements of an array using an array.
  2) =addPtr= adds the first two elements of an array using a pointer.

- Pseudocode: open it at [[https://onecompiler.com/c/43fzgsf3c][onecompiler.com/c/43fzgsf3c]] to code along
  #+begin_example C
    // include I/O functions
    /* function prototypes */
    // `addArr` adds the first two elements of an array using an array

    // `addPtr` adds the first two elements of an array using a pointer.

    /* main program */

    // BEGIN
       // initialize array `num` with 10, 20, 30

       // PRINT "Sum with array: " + addArr(num)

       // PRINT "Sum with pointer: " + addPtr(num)

    // END

    /* function definitions */
    // `addArr` adds the first two elements of an array using an array

    // BEGIN
       // return sum of first two elements
    // END

    // `addPtr` adds the first two elements of an array using a pointer.

    // BEGIN
       // return sum of first two elements
    // END
  #+end_example

- Solution:
  #+begin_src C :main no :includes
    #include <stdio.h> // include I/O functions
    /* function prototypes */
    // `addArr` adds the first two elements of an array using an array
    int addArr(int []);
    // `addPtr` adds the first two elements of an array using a pointer.
    int addPtr(int *);

    /* main program */
    int main(void)
    { // BEGIN
      // initialize array `num` with 10, 20, 30
      int num[] = {10,20,30};
      // PRINT "Sum with array: " + addArr(num)
      printf("Sum with array: %d\n", addArr(num));
      // PRINT "Sum with pointer: " + addPtr(num)
      printf("Sum with pointer: %d\n", addPtr(num));
      return 0;
    } // END

    /* function definitions */
    // `addArr` adds the first two elements of an array using an array
    int addArr(int arr[])
    { // BEGIN
      // return sum of first two elements
      return (arr[0] + arr[1]);
    } // END

    // `addPtr` adds the first two elements of an array using a pointer.
    int addPtr(int *ptr)
    { // BEGIN
      // return sum of first two elements (with pointer arithmetic)
      return (*ptr + *(ptr + 1)); // *ptr points at arr[0]
    } // END

  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : Sum with array: 30
  : Sum with pointer: 30

- Even though arrays decay to pointers in function calls, they are not
  the same type in general:
  | Feature            | Array                | Pointer                    |
  |--------------------+----------------------+----------------------------|
  | Memory allocation  | Fixed at declaration | Dynamic or points anywhere |
  | ~sizeof~ operator    | Total size           | Size of pointer            |
  | Pointer arithmetic | No                   | Yes                        |
  | Can be reassigned? | No (name is fixed)   | Yes (can point elsewhere)  |

* Challenge: Passing arrays and pointers to functions

- Write a program that
  1. Creates an array =arr= of 5 integers 100,200,300,400,500.
  2. Calls a function =printArr= that takes =arr= as argument and prints
     the array elements using array indexing: =arr[i]=.
  3. Calls another function =printPtr= that takes =arr= as argument and
     prints the elements using pointer arithmetic: =*(ptr + 1)=.

- Sample output:
  #+begin_example
    100 200 300 400 500 
    100 200 300 400 500 
  #+end_example

- Use this starter code: [[https://onecompiler.com/c/43fzk82nc][onecompiler.com/c/43fzk82nc]]
#+begin_example C
  // include I/O functions

  // define array size N = 5

  /* function prototypes */
  // printArr: print array using array indexing
  // pass array - return nothing

  // printPtr: print array using pointer arithmetic
  // pass pointer - return nothing


  /* main program */

  // BEGIN
    // initialize array

    // print array using array indexing

    // print a new line

    // print array using pointer arithmatic

  // END

  /* function definitions */
  // printArr: print array using array indexing

  // BEGIN
    // FOR i from 0 to N: PRINT array element with indexing

  // END
  // printPtr: print array using array indexing

  // BEGIN
    // FOR i from 0 to N: PRINT array element with pointer

  // END
#+end_example

- Solution:
  #+begin_src C :main no :includes
    #include <stdio.h> // include I/O functions

    #define N 5 // define array size N = 5
    
    /* function prototypes */
    // printArr: print array using array indexing
    // pass array - return nothing
    void printArr(int []);
    // printPtr: print array using pointer arithmetic
    // pass pointer - return nothing
    void printPtr(int *);

    /* main program */
    int main(void)
    { // BEGIN
      // initialize array
      int arr[N] = {100,200,300,400,500};
      // print array using array indexing
      printArr(arr);
      // print a new line
      puts("");
      // print array using pointer arithmatic
      printPtr(arr);
      return 0;    
    } // END

    /* function definitions */
    // printArr: print array using array indexing
    void printArr(int arr[])
    { // BEGIN
      // FOR i from 0 to N: PRINT array element with indexing
      for (int i=0; i < N; i++) printf("%d ", arr[i]);
    } // END
    // printPtr: print array using array indexing
    void printPtr(int *ptr)
    { // BEGIN
      // FOR i from 0 to N: PRINT array element with pointer
      for (int i=0; i < N; i++) printf("%d ", *(ptr + i));
    } // END
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : 100 200 300 400 500 
  : 100 200 300 400 500 

- Alternative solution: This only differs with regard to the ~for~
  loop - turns out if you're alread dealing with pointers, you can
  also use them in the loop definition!
  #+begin_src C :main no :includes
    #include <stdio.h> // include I/O functions

    #define N 5 // define array size N = 5
    
    /* function prototypes */
    // printArr: print array using array indexing
    // pass array - return nothing
    void printArr(int []);
    // printPtr: print array using pointer arithmetic
    // pass pointer - return nothing
    void printPtr2(int *);
