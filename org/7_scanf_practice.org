- This file is a practice file for C input functions ~scanf~.

- You will work through and complete the exercises using a shell.

- You can use Google Cloud Shell or any other Linux shell
  (e.g. Windows OS with WSL, or a Linux VM).

- For Google Cloud Shell, you need to be logged into your Google
  account & you have 50 hours of free usage per week.

- Time: approx. 30-45 min.

* Reading input with =scanf=

- You can open the exercises here on GitHub whenever you're lost.
  [[https://tinyurl.com/7-scanf-practice][tinyurl.com/7-scanf-practice]]

- We'll do these in class together and you will upload your results to
  Canvas (~"In-class practice 7: scanf"~).

- You will learn:
  + How to open a cloud command-line terminal (aka shell)
  + Create a new file with GNU =nano=
  + Save and rename files
  + Change and make directories
  + List, move, delete and rename files
  + Compile with changing the object file name

  + Open the editor and download a file
  + Compress files and upload archive files to Canvas

* Scan integer and floating-point input

*Problem*: Write a C program =scan1.c= that accepts two integer and two
floating-point values from the keyboard and prints them.

*Sample Input:*
#+begin_example
100 -1000 .456 -9.34e2
#+end_example

*Sample Output:*
#+begin_example
|  100|-1000|0.456| -934|
#+end_example

*Solution:*

1) Open a terminal.

2) Create a new file =scan1.c=.

3) Write the source code for a C program with input and output. Save
   at any point with =CTRL + s=.

4) Define two /integer/ variables ~k~, ~l~, and two /floating-point/ variables
   ~u~ and ~v~

5) Ask the user for input.

6) Complete the ~scanf~ /format string/ and enter the variables list to
   scan these variables

7) Save your file and compile it with =gcc= to check for syntax
   correctness. The standard executable is called =a.out=.

8) Run the executable using the relative path =./a.out= and enter the
   input by hand: ~100 -1000 .456 -9.34e2~

9) Alternatively, you can put the input into a file and redirect it to
   the executable. First create the input file:
   #+begin_src bash
     echo "100 -1000 .456 -9.34e2" > input1
     cat input1
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : 100 -1000 .456 -9.34e2

10) Next, run the file using the =input1= file:
    #+begin_example sh
    ./a.out < input1
    #+end_example

11) Fix the =scanf= format until you get the desired output[fn:3]:
    #+name: pgm:scanf_out
    #+begin_example
     |  100|-1000|0.456| -934|
    #+end_example

12) Compile your file with =gcc= once more, and name the executable
    (object file) =scan1= with the command:
    #+begin_example sh
    gcc scan1.c -o scan1
    #+end_example

13) Run the file using the relative path to the file and the input
    data:
    #+begin_example
    ./scan1 < input1
    #+end_example

14) If everything works, download the file to your PC (~Open editor~,
    find the file in the sidebar, right-click to ~Download~).

15) Revisit all that you learnt before tackling the next one!

listing, time-ordered), =clear= (clean up), =*= (globbing).

* Scanning ordinary characters

*Problem*: Write a C program =scan2.c= that accepts two integers separated
by a special character from the keyboard. Test the code with different
inputs to better understand the =scanf= command.

*Sample Input/Output:*
#+begin_example
 •5/•96   - this input should succeed
 •5 /•96  - this input should fail for the second number
 •.5 /•96 - this input should fail for both numbers
#+end_example

*Solution:*

1) Copy the previous program =scan1.c= into a new program =scan2.c= so
   that you don't have to rewrite all the code:
   #+begin_example sh
   cp -v scan1.c scan2.c
   ls scan*
   #+end_example
   
2) Now edit =scan2.c= using this code:
   #+name: pgm:ordTest1
   #+begin_src C :cmdline < ord1
     // variable declarations
     int i,j;

     // ask for keyboard input
     puts("Enter two integers separated by `/`:");

     // read keyboard input
     scanf("%d/%d",&i,&j);

     // print keyboard input
     printf("|%5d|%5d|\n",i,j);
   #+end_src

3) Compile the source code file and rename the object file to =scan2=:
   #+begin_example sh
   gcc scan2.c -o scan2
   #+end_example

4) Run the code block below with two inputs to compare:
   - ~•5/•96~ - this input should succeed
   - ~•5 /•96~ - this input should fail for the second number
   - ~•.5 /•96~ - this input should fail for both numbers

* Match input patterns exactly

*Tip:* Useful for the programming assignment "phone number conversion".

*Problem*: Write a C program =scan3.c= that extracts two integer numbers
from an input file with multiple special characters.

*Sample Input:*
#+begin_example
444==++//555
#+end_example

*Sample Output:*
#+begin_example
The numbers were: 444 and 555.
#+end_example

*Solution:*

1) Copy the previous program =scan2.c= into a new program =scan3.c= so
   that you don't have to rewrite all the code.

2) Put the following into an input file =input3=: ~444==++//555~
   #+begin_example sh
   echo "444==++//555" > input3
   cat input3
   #+end_example

3) Delete the lines asking the user for input.

4) Make sure that the =scanf= command is formatted correctly to receive
   the input in =input3= and return the two integers with =printf=:
   #+begin_example sh
   The numbers were 444 and 555.
   #+end_example

5) Compile =scan3.c= and rename the object file to =scan3=.

6) Run the object file passing the input through =input3=
   #+begin_example sh
   ./scan3 < input3
   #+end_example

* Add fractions

*Problem*: Write a C program =scan4.c= that prompts the user to add two
fractions and then displays the fractions and their sum.

*Sample Input:*
#+begin_example
5/6•
3/4
#+end_example

*Sample Output:*
#+begin_example
5/6 + 3/4 = 38/24
#+end_example

*Solution:*

1) Use the following command on the command-line shell to copy a
   template program from GitHub that you can then fill in:
   #+begin_src bash :results output :exports both
     wget -O scan4.c tinyurl.com/scan4-c
   #+end_src

2) Put the following *sample input* in an input file:
   #+begin_example
   5/6•
   3/4
   #+end_example

3) To do this, run this code on the command-line:
   #+begin_src bash :results output
     echo "5/6 " > input4
     echo "3/4"  >> input4
     cat input
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : 5/6
   : 3/4

4) The *sample output* for the input 5/6 and 3/4 is:
   #+begin_example
   5/6 + 3/4 = 38/24
   #+end_example

5) The program prompts the user to add two fractions and then display
   their sum. Complete the format strings below so that the program
   runs as intended!
   #+name: pgm:addFrac
   #+begin_src C :cmdline < addFrac_input :results output :tangle ../src/scan4.c
     // declare variables
     int num1, denom1, num2, denom2, result_num, result_denom;

     // scan input
     scanf("...", &num1, &denom1);
     scanf("...", &num2, &denom2);

     // compute numerator and denominator
     result_num = num1 * denom2 + num2 *denom1;
     result_denom = denom1 * denom2;

     // print result
     printf("%d/%d + %d/%d = %d/%d\n",
            num1, denom1, num2, denom2,
            result_num, result_denom);
   #+end_src

6) Compile the program into an object file =scan4= and run it with =input4=:
   #+begin_example sh
   gcc scan4.c -o scan4
   ./scan4 < input4
   #+end_example

7) When you got the right results, copy =scan4.c= into =scan5.c= using =cp
   -v=. Open the file with =nano=, update the filename at the top, and
   modify the program so that there is only *on* ~scanf~ statement. Make
   sure that the modified program yields the same result as before.

* Submit results to Canvas

*Problem*: Compress source code files and input files and submit the
compressed archive (=.zip=) file to Canvas.

*Solution:*

- At this point, you should have a bunch of =scan= and =input= files,
  including save files (=~=) and executables (object files):
  #+begin_example sh
    ls scan*.c input*
  #+end_example

  Output:
  #+begin_example
  input1  input4    scan2     scan2.cc~  scan3.cc  scan4.cc  scan5.cc  
  input3  scan1.cc  scan2.cc  scan3      scan4     scan5     scan5.cc~
  #+end_example

- Compress your source and input files into an archive file =scan.zip=
  (using the 'glob' character =*=):
  #+begin_example
  zip scan.zip scan1.c scan2.c scan3.c scan4.c scan5.c input*
  #+end_example
  Output:
  #+begin_example
  adding: scan1.cc (deflated 45%)
  adding: scan2.cc (deflated 48%)
  adding: scan3.cc (deflated 46%)
  adding: scan4.cc (deflated 52%)
  adding: scan5.cc (deflated 52%)
  adding: input1 (stored 0%)
  adding: input3 (stored 0%)
  adding: input4 (stored 0%)
  #+end_example

- You can look at the ZIP file with the command (finish by typing =q=):
  #+begin_example sh
    less sample.zip
  #+end_example

- This is what you should see:
  #+begin_example sh
