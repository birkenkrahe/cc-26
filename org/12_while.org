* README

- This script introduces C looping structures.

- This section is based on chapter 4 in Davenport/Vine (2015) and
  chapter 6 in King (2008).

- Practice workbooks, input files and PDF solution files in GitHub

* Loops

- A *loop* is a statement whose job is to repeatedly execute over
  some other statement (the *loop body*).

- Every loop has a *controlling expression*.

- Each time the loop body is executed (an *iteration* of the loop),
  the controlling expression is evaluated.

- If the expression is *TRUE* (has a value that is non-zero), the loop
  continues to execute.

- C provides three iteration statements: ~while~, ~do~, and ~for~

* The ~while~ statement
#+OPTIONS: toc:nil num:nil ^:nil: 
** Overview

- The ~while~ statement has the general form

  ~while ( /expression/ ) statement~

- The ~statement~ is executed as long as the ~expression~ is true.

** Simple example

- A simple example.
  #+name: double
  #+begin_example C
    while ( i < n ) {  /* controlling expression */
      i = i * 2;      /* loop body */
      }
  #+end_example

- Parentheses ~(...)~ around the /expression/ are mandatory

- Braces ~{ }~ are used for multi-line statements

- What does the code in [[double]] do?

- We can trace what happens:
  #+name: trace
  #+begin_src C
    int i = 1, n = 10;
    while ( i < n ) {
      i = i * 2;
      printf("%d < %d ?\n", i, n);
     }
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS: trace
  : 2 < 10 ?
  : 4 < 10 ?
  : 8 < 10 ?
  : 16 < 10 ?

- What would the pseudocode look like?
  #+begin_example
  While i is smaller than n
    double the value of i
    show i and n
  end when i is greater than n
  #+end_example

- What would a BPMN model look like?

** TODO Practice: First loop

- Your turn! Open an editor and enter the starter code:
  #+begin_example C
  int i = 1, n = ...;

  while (i < n) {
    i = i * 2;
    ...
  }
  #+end_example

  1) Set the loop limit =n= outside of the loop to 10.
  2) Insert a ~printf~ statement in the ~while~ loop body.
  3) Print the values of =i=, =n= and =i < n= for each iteration.
  4) Sample output:
     #+begin_example
     2 < 10 == 1
     4 < 10 == 1
     8 < 10 == 1
     16 < 10 == 0
     #+end_example

*** Solution:
#+begin_src C
  int i = 1, n = 10;

  while (i < n) {
    i = i * 2;
    printf("%d < %d == %d\n",i,n,i<n);
   }
#+end_src

** Countdown example

- What does the following statement do? What is printed out at the
  very end?
  #+begin_src C :tangle counting.c
    #define N 10
    int i = 0;
    printf("i = %d\n",i);
    while ( i < N ) {   //
      printf("T plus %d and counting\n", i);
      i++;  //
     }
    printf("i = %d\n", i); //
  #+end_src

- Solution (code with comments):
  #+name: counting
  #+begin_src C :tangle counting.c
    #define N 10 // Define loop limit as constant

    int i = 0;  // declaration and definition of loop variable

    printf("i = %d\n",i); // print loop variable before loop

    while ( i < N ) {   // tests if i is positive
      printf("T plus %d and counting\n", i);  // print i
      i++;  // same as i = i + 1; (executed from the right)
     }
    printf("i = %d\n", i); // print loop variable after loop
  #+end_src

- Why are we using ~i++~ and not ~++i~ ?[fn:1]

- What would change if we would swap the two statements inside the
  ~while~ loop?

- When would the ~while~ statements be bypassed completely?[fn:2]

- The code could be made more concise (shortened by one line) - can
  you guess how?  Remember what you know about =printf=?
  #+name: concise_counting
  #+begin_src C
    #define N 10
    int i = 0;
    printf("i = %d\n",i);
    while ( i < N ) {
      printf("T plus %d and counting\n", i++);
     }
    printf("i = %d\n",i);
  #+end_src

- Note that in the concise version, it makes a difference if we use
  ~i--~ or ~--i~. Try it!

** TODO Practice: Countdown

- Your turn! The program below counts down from ~i=N~ and prints both
  the counter variable and the end value.

  1) Enter the starter code:
     #+begin_src C :tangle counting.c
       #define N 10
       int i = ...;
       printf("i = %d\n", i);
       while ( ... ) {
         printf("T minus %d and counting\n", i);
         ...
           }
       printf("i = %d\n", i);
     #+end_src

  2) Fix the loop variable definition and the condition, and add a
     compound operator ~i--~ for counting down from =i=10=. Run the code.

  3) Change the operator to ~--i~ and check if there's a difference.

  4) Create a more concise version of the code by pulling the counting
     statement into the ~printf~ statement. Change the compound operator
     from ~i--~ to ~--i~.

*** Solution

- Completed code:
  #+begin_src C :tangle counting.c
    #define N 10
    int i = N;
    printf("i = %d\n", i);
    while ( i > 0 ) {
      printf("T minus %d and counting\n", i);
      i--;
     }
    printf("i = %d\n", i);
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  #+begin_example
  i = 10
  T minus 10 and counting
  T minus 9 and counting
  T minus 8 and counting
  T minus 7 and counting
  T minus 6 and counting
  T minus 5 and counting
  T minus 4 and counting
  T minus 3 and counting
  T minus 2 and counting
  T minus 1 and counting
  i = 0
  #+end_example

- More concise code:
  #+begin_src C :tangle concise.c
    #define N 10
    int i = N;
    printf("i = %d\n", i);
    while ( i > 0 ) {
      printf("T minus %d and counting\n", i--);
     }
    printf("i = %d\n", i);
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  #+begin_example
  i = 10
  T minus 10 and counting
  T minus 9 and counting
  T minus 8 and counting
  T minus 7 and counting
  T minus 6 and counting
  T minus 5 and counting
  T minus 4 and counting
  T minus 3 and counting
  T minus 2 and counting
  T minus 1 and counting
  i = 0
  #+end_example

** Infinite loops

- If the controlling expression always has a non-zero value, the
  ~while~ statement will not terminate.

- For example in a game a loop would have a statement like ~while(1~) because
  this condition is always true - until the player enters 'quit`

- The compiler does not check this. This program has to be stopped
  manually - in the online editor it runs out of memory after a few
  thousand lines or so:
  #+name: inf
  #+begin_example
    while (1)
      puts("Endless...\n");
  #+end_example

- To stop infinite loops from within, you need to provide ~break~,
  ~goto~ or ~return~ statements ("controlled jump").

** TODO Practice: Infinite loop

- Your turn! Complete a simple practice exercise under "Infinite
  loops" in the practice file.

- Create a program that runs forever:
  #+begin_example C
  while(...) {
    puts("Endless...");
  }
  #+end_example

- Run it and see what happens.

** TODO Exercise: Printing a table of squares

*** Problem

- Print ~n~ and its square as a table of ~n~ rows

* Footnotes

[fn:1] ~i++~ is evaluated from the left, while ~++i~ is evaluated from the
right. Both stand for ~i = i + 1~ , but ~i++~ assigns the current value of
~i~ and then adds ~1~, while ~++i~ adds ~1~ and then assigns the result to
~i~. In this case, the result is the same because we don't have any more
statements that use ~i~ but if there were, it would make a difference.

[fn:2]The loop body will not be entered if the expression tests out as
false, i.e. if ~i~ is zero or negative. Try that!
