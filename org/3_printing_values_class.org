* What are you going to learn?

The secret of the success of the machine is the separation of *value*
and *variable*, or of numbers and storage place. When we *operate* on
numbers, we can keep the original operands and the result in different
places. For the computer to understand what we want to do, it needs to
see reserved words, or *keywords*, that have a special meaning. One of
the advantages of C is that there are very few keywords. To handle
numbers with its limited memory, the computer needs to know what kind
or *type* of numbers they are (for example, large or small, whole or
decimal). Printing numbers of a certain type requires us to specify
their *format*.

*Topics*:
1) [X] Printing  (=printf= and =puts=)
2) [ ] Format (=%s=, =%i=, =%f=, =%c=)
3) [ ] Values (=1=, =1.0=)

* Code along in OneCompiler

To code along in OneCompiler:

1) Open =onecompiler.com/c=

2) Open =settings= and change =Title= to ="Printing values"=

3) In =Editor Settings=, =Disable Code Autocomplete/Suggestions=

4) Change file name from =Main.c= to =main.c= (there can be only one)

5) Delete the body of the code (single Hello World print statement)

6) Now write any code from the lecture in the body of =main=

7) Execute with =RUN=

8) You find the complete lecture in GitHub as =2_variables.org=

9) Equip your code along files with comments liberally!

10) You can find the completed code along file here:
    [[https://tinyurl.com/2ab5sjle][tinyurl.com/2ab5sjle]] or [[https://onecompiler.com/c/4357nb852][onecompiler.com/c/4357nb852]]

Each code along session will fill about one screen:
#+attr_html: :width 600px:
[[../img/variables_codealong.png]]

* Code along with Emacs

- You can also code along with Emacs using an Org-mode file.

- Open a shell in Emacs with =M-x shell= and download the file with
  #+begin_example
  wget -O practice.org tinyurl.com/cc-3-practice-org
  #+end_example

- Now open the file with =C-x C-f practice.org= and code away.

- Or: use the =test.org= file and create a new C code block with =<s TAB=
  and run code directly.

- It looks like this:

* Whitespace is (mostly) ignored

- As soon as a delimiter =;= is reached, all space ('whitespace') until
  the next command is ignored.

- Here is a version of the complete "Hello, world!" program that
  ignores whitespace at the expense of readability:

  #+begin_src C :results output
    #include<stdio.h>
    int main(void){puts("hello world");return 0;}
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:

- The only required space comes after reserved keywords (syntax
  highlighting reveals that because keywords are color-coded - though
  not in Colab).

- The /preprocessor/ directive =#include <stdio.h>= also must be on a line
  of its own.

* Values

- The machine only knows numbers:

  1) =1= is a whole or *integer* number:

     #+begin_src C
       printf("Integer number: %i\n", 1);
     #+end_src

     #+RESULTS:
     : Integer number: 1

  2) =1.0= is a decimal or *floating-point* number.

     #+begin_src C
       printf("Floating-point number: %.1f\n", 1.0);
     #+end_src

     #+RESULTS:
     : Floating-point number: 1.0

  3) ='1'= is a character (also stored as a number).

     #+begin_src C
       printf("Character: %c\n", '1');
     #+end_src

     #+RESULTS:
     : Character: 1

* Everything is a number

- To show that characters are stored as numbers, print it as a number:

  #+begin_src C :results output
    printf("Character: %c\n", 'A');
    printf("Character: %i\n", 'A');    
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : Character: A
  : Character: 65

- Though we'll mostly work with these three, C has many different ways
  of representing numbers.

- Which representation (for example, long or short) is the best
  depends on the problem.

- Example:

  1) Adding 1 + 1 and showing the result is =short=:

     #+begin_src C
       printf("%i + %i = %i\n", 1, 1, 1 + 1);
     #+end_src

     #+RESULTS:
     : 1 + 1 = 2

  2) Dividing Euler's number (=exp(1)= by Pi (=3.14159...=) is =long=:

     #+begin_src C
       #include <stdio.h>
       #include <math.h>
       
       printf("%.19f / %.19f = %.19f\n", exp(1), M_PI, 1E+9 / M_PI);
     #+end_src

     #+RESULTS:
     : 2.7182818284590450908 / 3.1415926535897931160 = 318309886.1837906837463378906

* PRACTICE About classroom practice sessions

- The =PRACTCE= exercises are for you to complete *in class*. If you're
  not able, you should complete them *at home* using the available Zoom
  recordings, and submit them *by the deadline*, or else.

- How you do this depends on you:

  1) If you have Emacs + Org-mode, you can do this effortlessly (but
     you have to know your way around Emacs + Org-mode). You can
     create new code blocks (like in Google Colab) and run them
     without having to enter =#include ... return 0= every time.

  2) If you only have a browser, you have choices as explained in the
     orientation lecture. =onecompiler.com= is the easiest:

     - Open [[https://onecompiler.com/c][onecompiler.com/c]] in the browser if you haven't done it yet.

     - Create a new project with a =main.c= file

     - Give it a suitable title like ="Variables - Practice"=, write a
       short description, like:
       #+begin_quote
       Project for practicing variables in C - CSC 100 class.
       #+end_quote
       and tag it:
       #+begin_example
       practice, variable, csc100
       #+end_example
       Make sure the visibility is *not private* so that you can post
       the link to Canvas if requested.

     - In the =editor settings=, check =Disable Code Autocomplete/Suggestions=

     - Delete the "hello world" template =printf= line and off you go!

* PRACTICE Everything is a number

- What do you get when you get the format wrong? The results will
  surprise you.

- Print these values using the requested format in a =printf= call:

  |   | VALUE | FORMAT         | SPECIFIER |
  |---+-------+----------------+-----------|
  | 1 | =3.14=  | integer        | =%i=        |
  | 2 | =3.14=  | character      | =%c=        |
  | 3 | =3=     | floating-point | =%f=        |
  | 4 | =3=     | character      | =%c=        |
  | 5 | ='3'=   | integer        | =%i=        |
  | 6 | ='3'=   | floating-point | =%f=        |

- Solution & Explanation:

  1. *Printing a floating-point number as an integer:* The output is an
     integer representation of the bits read by =printf= - it changes
     because the mismatch between the format specifier and the value
     argument causes *undefined behavior*.

     #+begin_src C :main yes :includes <stdio.h> :results output :exports both
       printf("%i\n",3.14);
     #+end_src

     #+RESULTS:
     : 789241224

  2. *Printing a floating-point number as character*: Prints a garbage
     character (not recognized as an ASCII character).

     #+begin_src C :main yes :includes <stdio.h> :results output :exports both
       printf("%c\n",3.14);
     #+end_src

     #+RESULTS:
     : X

  3. *Printing an integer as floating-point number*: Undefined behavior
     again. This result could also be another value.

     #+begin_src C :results output
       printf("%f\n",3);
     #+end_src

     #+RESULTS:
     : 0.000000

  4. *Printing an integer as character*: =3= is interpreted as the
     character with the ASCII code 3.

     #+begin_src C :results output
       printf("%c\n",3.14);
     #+end_src

     #+RESULTS:
     : ˆ

  5. *Printing a character as an integer*: Results in printing the ASCII
     code of the character.

     #+begin_src C :results output
       printf("%i\n",'3');
     #+end_src

     #+RESULTS:
     : 51

  6. *Printing a character as a floating-point number*: Undefined
     behavior.

     #+begin_src C :results output
       printf("%f\n",'3');
     #+end_src

     #+RESULTS:
     : 0.000000

* PRACTICE Print challenge

- Print =3.14 - 3 = .14= using =printf= and the values =3.14=, =3=, and =.14=

- Use both the format and the value part of the =printf= function.

#+begin_src C :results output
  printf("%f - %i = %f\n", 3.14, 3, .14);
  printf("%.2f - %i = %.2f\n", 3.14, 3, .14);
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: 3.140000 - 3 = 0.140000
: 3.14 - 3 = 0.14

* Summary: Printing Values in C

1. *Values* are data items like numbers or characters that the computer processes.
2. *Variables* store values and are referenced by unique names.
3. *Types* define what kind of values variables can hold (e.g., =int= for whole numbers, =float= for decimals).
4. *Format specifiers* like =%i= (integer), =%f= (float), and =%s= (string) control how values are printed.
5. *Keywords* are reserved words in C that the compiler understands as commands.
6. *Functions* like =printf()= are essential to printing values in C.
